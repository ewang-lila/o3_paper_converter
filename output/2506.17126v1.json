In relaxor ferroelectrics, the dielectric maximum occurs at a frequency-dependent temperature \\( T_M \\) with peak value \\( \\varepsilon_M'(f) \\). To phenomenologically capture the diffuse phase transition, the Curie-Weiss law is modified by introducing a diffuseness exponent \\( \\gamma \\) so that the deviation from the maximum reciprocal permittivity is given as a power law in \\( T-T_M \\).  \n\n**Task.** Derive the modified expression for the dielectric response that defines the diffuseness parameter \\( \\gamma \\) in terms of \\( \\varepsilon'(T) \\), \\( \\varepsilon_M'(f) \\), \\( T-T_M(f) \\), and \\( C \\).\n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon'}-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_M'(f)}=\\frac{1}{C}\\,(T-T_M(f))^\\gamma.\n\\]\n*(Equation (2) in the paper)*\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2  \n**Background.** In perovskite ferroelectric materials such as lead scandium tantalate (PST), the degree of structural B‚Äêsite ordering is characterized by comparing the intensities of two x-ray diffraction peaks. The intensity \\( I_{111} \\) corresponds to the pseudocubic (111) superstructure peak that appears only when there is ordering, and \\( I_{200} \\) corresponds to the symmetry-allowed fundamental (200) peak. For a perfectly ordered system, the theoretical intensity ratio is denoted by  \n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{I_{111}}{I_{200}}\\right)_{S=1}.\n\\]  \nAn ordering coefficient \\( S \\) is introduced such that its square scales the measured intensity ratio to the ideal one.  \n\n**Task.** Derive the expression for the ordering coefficient \\( S \\) in terms of the measured intensity ratio \\( I_{111}/I_{200} \\) and the theoretical ratio for a perfectly ordered system.\n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nS^2 = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{I_{111}}{I_{200}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{I_{111}}{I_{200}}\\right)_{S=1}}.\n\\]\n*(Equation (3) in the paper)*\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3  \n**Background.** Experimental studies on PST have revealed that the diffuseness of the phase transition, quantified by the exponent \\( \\gamma \\), depends on the degree of structural ordering represented by the coefficient \\( S \\). When the sample is fully disordered (\\( S=0 \\)), relaxor behavior is manifested with \\( \\gamma \\) near 2, whereas nearly perfect ordering (\\( S \\) close to 1) yields ferroelectric behavior with \\( \\gamma \\) around 1. A linear relation between \\( \\gamma \\) and \\( S \\) has been found to describe the experimental data across different sample geometries.  \n\n**Task.** Derive the linear relation between the diffuseness exponent \\( \\gamma \\) and the ordering parameter \\( S \\).\n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\n\\gamma(S) = 1.93 - 1.06\\,S.\n\\]\n*(As stated in the paper)*"
