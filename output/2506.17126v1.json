In this description, the dielectric permittivity is denoted by \\(\\varepsilon'\\), the absolute temperature by \\(T\\), and the temperature of maximum permittivity by \\(T_M\\); the value of the permittivity at \\(T_M\\) is \\(\\varepsilon_M'\\). In addition, a Curie-like constant \\(C\\) and a diffuseness exponent \\(\\gamma\\) (with \\(\\gamma=1\\) corresponding to a normal ferroelectric and \\(\\gamma=2\\) to an ideal relaxor) are introduced to quantify the spread of the transition. The phenomenological expression relates these quantities by comparing the reciprocal permittivities.  \n\n**Task.** Derive the analytic expression that relates \\(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon'}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_M'}\\) to the difference \\(T-T_M\\) and the exponent \\(\\gamma\\), with the proportionality constant \\(1/C\\).\n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon'}-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_M'(f)}=\\frac{1}{C}\\Bigl(T-T_M(f)\\Bigr)^\\gamma.\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2  \n**Background.** In perovskite lead scandium tantalate (PST), the degree of B-site ordering is quantified by analyzing the intensity of specific X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks. The pseudocubic (111) reflection appears as a superstructure peak only in the presence of Rocksalt-type ordering of the B-site cations, whereas the (200) reflection is allowed regardless of ordering. Let \\(I_{111}\\) and \\(I_{200}\\) be the XRD peak intensities of the (111) and (200) reflections, respectively, and let the quantity \\(\\left(\\frac{I_{111}}{I_{200}}\\right)_{S=1}\\) denote the intensity ratio expected for a perfectly ordered sample. The ordering parameter \\(S\\) (with \\(0 \\leq S \\leq 1\\)) is defined by comparing the measured ratio to that of the fully ordered case.  \n\n**Task.** Derive the analytic formula for \\(S^2\\) in terms of the measured intensity ratio \\(\\frac{I_{111}}{I_{200}}\\) and its fully ordered value \\(\\left(\\frac{I_{111}}{I_{200}}\\right)_{S=1}\\).\n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nS^2 = \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{I_{111}}{I_{200}}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{I_{111}}{I_{200}}\\right)_{S=1}}.\n\\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3  \n**Background.** Experimental investigations on PST have demonstrated a direct quantitative connection between the structural order and the diffuseness of the phase transition. Here, the structural ordering is quantified by the ordering parameter \\(S\\) (with \\(0\\) corresponding to complete disorder and \\(1\\) to full Rocksalt order) and the relaxor nature by the diffuseness exponent \\(\\gamma\\) (where \\(\\gamma=2\\) corresponds to perfect relaxor behavior and \\(\\gamma\\approx1\\) to a normal ferroelectric transition). Empirical data over a wide range of sample geometries (thin films, multilayer capacitors, and bulk ceramics) reveal a linear correlation between \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(S\\).  \n\n**Task.** Derive the linear relation between the diffuseness exponent \\(\\gamma\\) and the structural order parameter \\(S\\).\n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\n\\gamma(S) = 1.93 - 1.06\\, S.\n\\]\n\n"
