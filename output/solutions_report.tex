\subsection*{Problem 1 (Paper: 2506.17853v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
A robotic mechanical metamaterial is described by a continuum reaction-diffusion system for its dimensionless angular displacements $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as functions of dimensionless spatial coordinate $\bar{x}$ and dimensionless time $\bar{t}$. The dynamics are governed by the following coupled partial differential equations:
$$
\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \bar{t}} = k_\alpha \Delta \alpha + R_\alpha(\alpha,\beta)
$$
$$
\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \bar{t}} = \frac{k_\beta}{\gamma} \Delta \beta + \frac{1}{\gamma}R_\beta(\alpha,\beta)
$$
where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator, $k_\alpha$ and $k_\beta$ are linearized torsional stiffnesses, and $\gamma = \eta_\beta/\eta_\alpha$ is the ratio of effective viscous coefficients. The non-conservative reaction functions are given by:
$$
R_{\alpha}(\alpha,\beta) = k_{\alpha\beta} (\beta-\alpha)-\psi'(\alpha)-\sigma\beta
$$
$$
R_{\beta}(\alpha,\beta) = k_{\alpha\beta} (\alpha-\beta)
$$
Here, $k_{\alpha\beta}$ and $\sigma$ are positive constants. The term $\psi'(\alpha)$ is a non-monotonic, odd, piecewise continuous tri-linear function with three roots at $\alpha=\{0,\pm\alpha^*\}$. Its derivative, $\psi''(\alpha)$, is given by:
$$
\psi''(\alpha)=\begin{cases}
		k_2, & |\alpha|\leq k_1\alpha^*/(k_1-k_2),
		\cr k_1, & |\alpha|>k_1\alpha^*/(k_1-k_2),
	\end{cases}
$$
where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are constants. The system has a homogeneous equilibrium state at $(\alpha,\beta)=(0,0)$. For linear stability analysis, a perturbation from this equilibrium is considered, which can be Fourier-expanded with spatial frequency $\kappa=2\pi/\lambda$.

Task:
Derive the matrix $\mathbf{J}_\mathbf{\kappa}$ for the linear stability analysis of this system, which is defined as $\mathbf{J}_\mathbf{\kappa}=\mathbf{J}_\mathbf{R}-\kappa^2\mathbf{D}$, where $\mathbf{J}_\mathbf{R}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the reaction terms evaluated at the equilibrium state, and $\mathbf{D}$ is the diffusion matrix.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{\mathbf{J}_\mathbf{\kappa} = \begin{bmatrix}
-k_{\alpha\beta}-\psi''(0)-\kappa^2 k_\alpha & k_{\alpha\beta}-\sigma \\
k_{\alpha\beta}/\gamma & -k_{\alpha\beta}/\gamma-\kappa^2 k_{\beta}/\gamma
\end{bmatrix}} \]

\subsubsection*{Model Outputs}
\subsubsection*{Model: o3 (Score: 0.5)}
\paragraph*{Model Solution:}
\mathbf{J}_{\kappa}=
\begin{pmatrix}
-\left(k_{\alpha\beta}+k_{2}\right)-k_{\alpha}\,\kappa^{2} & k_{\alpha\beta}-\sigma\\[4pt]
\dfrac{k_{\alpha\beta}}{\gamma} & -\dfrac{k_{\alpha\beta}}{\gamma}-\dfrac{k_{\beta}}{\gamma}\,\kappa^{2}
\end{pmatrix}

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression for the top-left element is:
\[
-k_{\alpha\beta} - \psi''(0) - \kappa^2 k_\alpha
\]

The model-generated expression for the top-left element is:
\[
-\left(k_{\alpha\beta} + k_2\right) - k_\alpha \kappa^2
\]

Here, the model uses \(k_2\) instead of \(\psi''(0)\). Since \(\psi''(0)\) is a specific term (likely the second derivative of some function \(\psi\) evaluated at zero), replacing it with \(k_2\) is not necessarily equivalent unless \(k_2 = \psi''(0)\), which is not stated. This is a substitution of a variable that changes the meaning unless explicitly defined as equal.

The other elements match exactly in form and coefficients:
- Top-right: \(k_{\alpha\beta} - \sigma\)
- Bottom-left: \(k_{\alpha\beta}/\gamma\)
- Bottom-right: \(-k_{\alpha\beta}/\gamma - \kappa^2 k_\beta/\gamma\)

Since the only difference is the replacement of \(\psi''(0)\) by \(k_2\), which is not justified or stated as equivalent, this counts as one minor error.

According to the rubric, one minor error (one wrong variable or missing minor constant term) warrants a partial credit score of 0.5.

Score: 0.5

\subsection*{Problem 2 (Paper: 2506.17853v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
The dynamics of a robotic mechanical metamaterial, comprising two interacting subsystems with local rotational freedoms $\alpha$ and $\beta$, can be described by a set of dimensionless reaction-diffusion equations. For simplicity, overbars denoting dimensionless quantities are omitted. The governing equations are given by:
\begin{align*}
    \alpha_{,t}&=\Delta \alpha+R_\alpha(\alpha,\beta),\\
    \gamma \beta_{,t}&=d\Delta \beta+R_\beta(\alpha,\beta),
\end{align*}
where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator, $t$ is dimensionless time, $\gamma=\eta_\beta/\eta_\alpha$ is the ratio of temporal characteristics, and $d=k_\beta/k_\alpha$ is the ratio of diffusive characteristics. The reaction terms $R_\alpha(\alpha,\beta)$ and $R_\beta(\alpha,\beta)$ are defined as:
\begin{align*}
    R_{\alpha}(\alpha,\beta) & = k_{\alpha\beta} (\beta-\alpha)-\psi'(\alpha)-\sigma\beta,\\
    R_{\beta}(\alpha,\beta) & = k_{\alpha\beta} (\alpha-\beta),
\end{align*}
where $k_{\alpha\beta}$ is a stiffness parameter for reciprocal interaction, $\sigma$ is a feedback parameter for the non-reciprocal term, and $\psi'(\alpha)$ is a non-monotonic function. For the quiescent, spatially uniform state, $\mathbf{\Phi}_0=(\alpha_0,\beta_0)=(0,0)$, the derivative of $\psi'(\alpha)$ evaluated at $\alpha_0=0$ is $\psi''(0)=k_2$. To analyze the stability of this uniform state, a small perturbation of the form $\mathbf{\Phi}(\bar{x},\bar{t}) = \mathbf{\Phi}_0 + \tilde{\mathbf{\Phi}}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\kappa\bar{x} + \Omega \bar{t}}$ is introduced, where $\tilde{\mathbf{\Phi}}^\mathrm{T}=[\tilde{\alpha},\tilde{\beta}]$ represents the perturbation amplitude, $\mathrm{i}$ is the imaginary unit, $\kappa$ is the spatial frequency, and $\Omega$ is the perturbation growth rate. The system can be written compactly as $\mathbf{\Phi},_{t}=\mathbf{D}\Delta\mathbf{\Phi}+\bar{\mathbf{R}}(\alpha,\beta)$, where $\mathbf{\Phi}^\mathrm{T}=[\alpha,\beta]$, $\mathbf{D}=\mathrm{diag}[1,d/\gamma]$, and $\bar{\mathbf{R}}^\mathrm{T}(\alpha,\beta)=[R_\alpha(\alpha,\beta),R_\beta(\alpha,\beta)/\gamma]$. The perturbation growth rates $\Omega$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{J}_\mathbf{\kappa}=\mathbf{J}_\mathbf{R}-\kappa^2\mathbf{D}$, where $\mathbf{J}_\mathbf{R}$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\bar{\mathbf{R}}(\alpha,\beta)$ evaluated at $\mathbf{\Phi}_0$.

Task: Derive the expressions for the perturbation growth rates, $\Omega_{1,2}(\kappa)$, in terms of the system parameters $k_{\alpha\beta}$, $\sigma$, $k_2$, $d$, $\gamma$, and $\kappa$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{\Omega_{1,2}(\kappa)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\left(-\frac{k_{\alpha\beta}(\gamma+1)+k_2\gamma}{\gamma} - \frac{\gamma+d}{\gamma}\kappa^2\right)\pm\sqrt{\left(-\frac{k_{\alpha\beta}(\gamma+1)+k_2\gamma}{\gamma} - \frac{\gamma+d}{\gamma}\kappa^2\right)^2-\frac{4}{\gamma} \left[ k_{\alpha\beta}(k_2+\sigma) + (k_{\alpha\beta}(d+1) + k_2 d)\kappa^2 + d\kappa^4 \right]}\right)} \]

\sqrt{\left(a+\frac{b}{\gamma}\right)^{2}
-\frac{4}{\gamma}\Big[a\,b-k_{\alpha\beta}(k_{\alpha\beta}-\sigma)\Big]}

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is a complicated formula for \(\Omega_{1,2}(\kappa)\) involving terms with \(k_{\alpha\beta}\), \(k_2\), \(\gamma\), \(d\), \(\sigma\), and powers of \(\kappa\). It has the form:

\[
\Omega_{1,2}(\kappa) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left( -\frac{k_{\alpha\beta}(\gamma+1) + k_2 \gamma}{\gamma} - \frac{\gamma + d}{\gamma} \kappa^2 \right) \pm \sqrt{ \left( -\frac{k_{\alpha\beta}(\gamma+1) + k_2 \gamma}{\gamma} - \frac{\gamma + d}{\gamma} \kappa^2 \right)^2 - \frac{4}{\gamma} \left[ k_{\alpha\beta}(k_2 + \sigma) + (k_{\alpha\beta}(d+1) + k_2 d) \kappa^2 + d \kappa^4 \right] } \right)
\]

The model-generated expression is:

\[
\Omega_{1,2}(\kappa) = -\frac{1}{2} \left(a + \frac{b}{\gamma}\right) \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \left(a + \frac{b}{\gamma}\right)^2 - \frac{4}{\gamma} \left[ a b - k_{\alpha\beta}(k_{\alpha\beta} - \sigma) \right] }
\]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are not defined in the model expression, but presumably represent some combinations of parameters.

**Key points of comparison:**

1. **Form and structure:**
   - The ground truth has a factor of \(\frac{1}{2}\) multiplying the entire expression inside the parentheses.
   - The model expression has \(-\frac{1}{2}(a + \frac{b}{\gamma})\) plus/minus \(\frac{1}{2}\) times the square root.
   - The ground truth expression has the first term inside the parentheses as a sum of two negative terms, while the model expression has a negative sign outside the first term.

2. **Variables and terms inside the square root:**
   - Ground truth: inside the square root is the square of the first term minus \(\frac{4}{\gamma}\) times a complicated polynomial in \(\kappa\).
   - Model: inside the square root is the square of \((a + \frac{b}{\gamma})\) minus \(\frac{4}{\gamma}\) times \([a b - k_{\alpha\beta}(k_{\alpha\beta} - \sigma)]\).

3. **Dependence on \(\kappa\):**
   - Ground truth explicitly includes \(\kappa^2\) and \(\kappa^4\) terms.
   - Model expression does not explicitly show \(\kappa\) dependence, and the terms inside the square root do not match the polynomial structure in the ground truth.

4. **Coefficients and signs:**
   - The model expression has a negative sign outside the first term, which is not consistent with the ground truth.
   - The terms inside the square root differ significantly in structure and content.

5. **Undefined variables:**
   - The model uses \(a\) and \(b\) without defining them, making it impossible to verify equivalence.

**Conclusion:**

The model-generated expression is structurally different, missing explicit \(\kappa\) dependence, has different terms inside the square root, and uses undefined variables \(a\) and \(b\). It does not match the ground truth expression or its mathematical content.

Therefore, the model expression is **incorrect**.

\subsection*{Problem 3 (Paper: 2506.18641v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider an undirected and unweighted network $G=(V,E)$ with $N$ nodes. Let $\mathbf{A}$ be its adjacency matrix, where $A_{ij}=1$ if nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise. Let $\mathbf{D}$ be the diagonal degree matrix, where $D_{ii}$ is the degree of node $i$. The Laplacian matrix of the network is defined as $\mathbf{L = D - A}$. The Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}$ is a real symmetric matrix, and thus it has $N$ real eigenvalues, denoted as $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_N$.

The partition function $Z_{\tau}$ is a core concept for understanding information flow in networks, defined as:
$$Z_{\tau} = \text{Tr}(e^{-\tau \mathbf{L}})$$
where $\tau$ is a positive diffusion scale parameter. The network density matrix $\pmb{\rho}_{\tau}$ is defined as:
$$\pmb{\rho}_{\tau} = \frac{e^{-\tau \mathbf{L}}}{Z_{\tau}}$$
The spectral entropy $S_{\tau}$ measures the diversity of information propagation paths and is defined as:
$$S_{\tau} = -\text{Tr}(\pmb{\rho}_{\tau} \log \pmb{\rho}_{\tau})$$

Task:
Derive the expression for the spectral entropy $S_{\tau}$ in terms of the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of the Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}$ and the diffusion scale parameter $\tau$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{S_{\tau} = \frac{\tau \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i e^{-\tau \lambda_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^N e^{-\tau \lambda_j}} + \log \left( \sum_{j=1}^N e^{-\tau \lambda_j} \right)} \]

\paragraph*{Model Solution:}
\, S_{\tau}= \ln\!\Bigl(\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{-\tau\lambda_i}\Bigr)
        + \tau\,\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_i\,e^{-\tau\lambda_i}}
                         {\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{-\tau\lambda_i}} \,

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The model-generated expression is:

\[
S_{\tau} = \ln\left(\sum_{i=1}^N e^{-\tau \lambda_i}\right) + \tau \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i e^{-\tau \lambda_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^N e^{-\tau \lambda_i}}
\]

The ground truth expression is:

\[
S_{\tau} = \frac{\tau \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i e^{-\tau \lambda_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^N e^{-\tau \lambda_j}} + \log \left( \sum_{j=1}^N e^{-\tau \lambda_j} \right)
\]

Comparing the two:

- The summation indices differ in the denominator of the fraction: the ground truth uses \(j\) while the model uses \(i\). This is irrelevant since the index is a dummy variable.
- The order of terms is reversed, but addition is commutative.
- The logarithm is written as \(\log\) in the ground truth and \(\ln\) in the model. In mathematics and physics, \(\log\) often denotes the natural logarithm unless otherwise specified, so this is acceptable.
- The expressions are mathematically identical.

Therefore, the model-generated expression matches the ground truth exactly in mathematical content.

\subsection*{Problem 4 (Paper: 2506.18641v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider an undirected and unweighted network $G=(V,E)$ with $N$ nodes. Let $\mathbf{A}$ be the adjacency matrix of the network, where $A_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge between node $i$ and node $j$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise. Let $\mathbf{D}$ be the diagonal degree matrix, where $D_{ii}$ is the degree of node $i$. The Laplacian matrix of the network is defined as $\mathbf{L = D - A}$. Since $\mathbf{L}$ is a real symmetric matrix, it can be diagonalized, meaning there exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors $\mathbf{u}_1, \dots, \mathbf{u}_N$ corresponding to real eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_N$. The matrix exponential $e^{\mathbf{M}}$ for any square matrix $\mathbf{M}$ is defined by its Taylor series expansion as $e^{\mathbf{M}} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\mathbf{M}^k}{k!}$. The trace of a square matrix $\mathbf{M}$, denoted as $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{M})$, is the sum of its diagonal elements. In the context of network information flow, the partition function $Z_{\tau}$ is defined as $Z_{\tau} = \text{Tr}(e^{-\tau \mathbf{L}})$, where $\tau$ is a positive diffusion scale parameter.

Task:
Derive the expression for the partition function $Z_{\tau}$ solely in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{Z_{\tau} = \sum_{i=1}^N e^{-\tau \lambda_i}} \]

\subsubsection*{Model: o3 (Score: 1.0)}
\paragraph*{Model Solution:}
\,Z_{\tau} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{-\tau \lambda_i}\,

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The model-generated expression is exactly the same as the ground truth expression. Both have the same summation limits, the same exponential function, and the same variables and signs. The only difference is the presence of some extra spacing characters (\,) which do not affect the mathematical equivalence.

\subsection*{Problem 5 (Paper: 2506.19617v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a network composed of two clusters, each containing $N$ mobile Rössler chaotic oscillators. The internal dynamics of the $i^{th}$ oscillator in the first cluster are described by:
$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\dot x_i^1 =  - x_i^2 - x_i^3\\
\dot x_i^2 = x_i^1 + ax_i^2 + {\epsilon }\sum\limits_{j = 1}^N {g_{ij}^1(t)\left( {x_j^2 - x_i^2} \right)} + \mu {D_{xy}}\left( {\overline {y}^2   - x_i^2} \right) \\
\dot x_i^3 = b + x_i^3\left( {x_i^1 - c} \right)
\end{array} \right.
$$
And for the $i^{th}$ oscillator in the second cluster:
$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\dot y_i^1 =  - y_i^2 - y_i^3\\
\dot y_i^2 = y_i^1 + ay_i^2 + {\epsilon }\sum\limits_{j = 1}^N {g_{ij}^2(t)\left( {y_j^2 - y_i^2} \right)} + \mu {D_{yx}}\left( {\overline {x}^2   - y_i^2} \right) \\
\dot y_i^3 = b + y_i^3\left( {y_i^1 - c} \right)
\end{array} \right.
$$
Here, $a, b, c$ are constant Rössler parameters, $\epsilon$ is the intra-cluster coupling coefficient, and $\mu$ is the inter-cluster coupling coefficient. $\overline{x}^2 = \frac{1}{m_1}\sum_{j=1}^{m_1} g_{ij}^1x_j^2$ and $\overline{y}^2 = \frac{1}{m_2}\sum_{j=1}^{m_2} g_{ij}^2y_j^2$ represent the local centers of mass for the first and second cluster, respectively, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ denote the number of nodes within the vision size in each cluster.

The intra-cluster connectivity $g_{ij}^k(t)$ between oscillators $i$ and $j$ in cluster $k$ is defined as:
$$
g_{ij}^k  = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
 1\,\,\,if\,\,d_{ij}^k  \le d_0^k  \\
 0\,\,\,otherwise, \\
 \end{array} \right.
$$
where $d_{ij}^k(t) = \sqrt {{{\left( {{\eta^k _i}(t) - {\eta^k _j}(t)} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {{\xi^k _i}(t) - {\xi^k _j}(t)} \right)}^2}}$ is the Euclidean distance between agents $i$ and $j$ in cluster $k$, and $d_0^k$ is the agent vision size control parameter.

The inter-cluster connectivity functions $D_{XY}$ and $D_{YX}$ are defined as:
$$
D_{XY} = D_{YX}  = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
 1\,\,\,if\,\,s_{XY},s_{YX}  \le s_0  \\
 0\,\,\,otherwise \\
 \end{array} \right.
$$
where $s_{XY} = s_{YX} = \sqrt {{{\left( {{X^1}(t) - {X^2}(t)} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {{Y^1}(t) - {Y^2}(t)} \right)}^2}}$ is the Euclidean distance between the lower-left corners of the clusters, and $s_0$ is the maximum distance threshold for inter-cluster connectivity.

To analyze the stability of synchronization between clusters, an error system is defined as $e_i^k = x_i^k - y_i^k$ for $k=1,2,3$ and $i=1,2,...,N$. The dynamics of the error system are given by:
$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\dot e_i^1 =  - e_i^2 - e_i^3\\
\dot e_i^2 = e_i^1 + ae_i^2 + \epsilon \sum\limits_j^N {{g_{ij}^1\left( {e_j^2 - e_i^2} \right) }} + \epsilon {f_{1i}} + \\
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mu {D_{xy}}\left[ { - e_i^2 - \frac{1}{{{m_2}}}\sum\limits_j^{{m_2}} {g _{ij}^2e_j^2}  + {f_{2i}}} \right]\\
\dot e_i^3 =  - ce_i^3 + e_i^1y_i^3 + e_i^3y_i^1
\end{array} \right.
$$
where ${f_{1i}} = \sum\limits_j^{{N}} {\left( {g_{ij}^1 - g_{ij}^2} \right)\left( {y_j^2 - y_i^2} \right)}$ and ${f_{2i}} = \frac{1}{{{m_1}}}\sum\limits_j^{{m_1}} {g _{ij}^1y_j^2}  - \frac{1}{{{m_2}}}\sum\limits_j^{{m_2}} {g _{ij}^2y_j^2}$. For simplicity, the non-linear term $e_i^1 e_i^3$ in $\dot e_i^3$ is disregarded due to its negligible size as the system approaches synchronization.

A Lyapunov function candidate $V_i$ is defined as:
$$
{V_i} = \frac{1}{2}\left( {{{\left( {e_i^1} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {e_i^2} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {e_i^3} \right)}^2}} \right) + \int\limits_0^t {\left( {{\gamma _1}{{\left( {e_i^1} \right)}^2} + {\gamma _2}{{\left( {e_i^3} \right)}^2}} \right)dt}
$$
where ${\gamma _1}$ and ${\gamma _2}$ are parameters to be determined. The time derivative of this Lyapunov function candidate is:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
{{\dot V}_i} = \left( {-1 + y_i^3} \right)e_i^1e_i^3 + a{\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2} - c{\left( {e_i^3} \right)^2} + y_i^1{\left( {e_i^3} \right)^2} + {\gamma _1}{\left( {e_i^1} \right)^2}\\
 - {\gamma _1}{\left( {e_i^1\left( 0 \right)} \right)^2} + {\gamma _2}{\left( {e_i^3} \right)^2} - {\gamma _2}{\left( {e_i^3\left( 0 \right)} \right)^2} + \epsilon \sum\limits_{j \ne i}^N {g_{ij}^1e_j^2e_i^2}  - \\
\epsilon {\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2}\sum\limits_{j \ne i}^N {g_{ij}^1}  + e_i^2\epsilon {{f_{1i}}}  - \mu {D_{xy}}\left( {1 + \frac{1}{{{m_2}}}} \right){\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2} - \\
\frac{{\mu {D_{xy}}}}{{2{m_2}}}\sum\limits_j^{{m_2}} {g _{ij}^2e_j^2e_i^2}  + e_i^2\mu {D_{xy}}{f_{2i}}
\end{array}
$$
Assume $y_m^1 = \max\left| {y_i^1} \right|$ and $y_m^3 = \max\left| {y_i^3} \right|$.
Use the mathematical property $\left| A \right|\left| B \right| \le \frac{1}{2}\left( {{A^2} + {B^2}} \right)$ for real numbers $A$ and $B$.
Assume there exist real positive constants $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ such that $\sum\limits_{\scriptstyle j = 1,\hfill\atop \scriptstyle j \ne i\hfill}^N {g_{ij}^1{{\left( {e_j^2} \right)}^2}} \le {Z_1}{\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2}$ and $\sum\limits_{\scriptstyle j = 1,\hfill\atop \scriptstyle j \ne i\hfill}^{{m_2}} {g _{ij}^2{{\left( {e_j^2} \right)}^2}} \le {Z_2}{\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2}$. Let $Z = \max\left( {Z_1, Z_2} \right)$.
Set ${\gamma _1} = \frac{1}{2}\left( {1 + y_m^3} \right)$ and ${\gamma _2} = y_m^1 - c + \frac{1}{2}\left( {1 + y_m^3} \right)$.

Task:
Starting from the given expression for $\dot V_i$, apply the stated mathematical property $\left| A \right|\left| B \right| \le \frac{1}{2}\left( {{A^2} + {B^2}} \right)$ to all product terms involving error components (e.g., $e_i^1 e_i^3$, $e_j^2 e_i^2$, $e_i^2 f_{1i}$, $e_i^2 f_{2i}$). Then, substitute the definitions of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, and use the $Z$ bound to replace the terms involving $\sum g_{ij}^1 (e_j^2)^2$ and $\sum g_{ij}^2 (e_j^2)^2$. Finally, collect all terms proportional to ${\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2}$ to determine the expression for $f3_{max}$.

   - \(- \mu D_{xy} \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{m_2} \right)\)  
   - \(- \frac{\epsilon}{2} \sum_{j \neq i} g_{ij}^1\)

2. The model expression has three terms:  
   - \(a\)  
   - \(\frac{\epsilon}{2}(1 + Z)\)  
   - \(\frac{\mu D_{xy}}{4 m_2} (Z - m_2 - 4)\)

3. The model expression does not include the summation term \(- \frac{\epsilon}{2} \sum_{j \neq i} g_{ij}^1\) at all, which is a significant omission.

4. The model's \(\frac{\epsilon}{2}(1 + Z)\) term does not match the ground truth's \(\frac{1}{2} \epsilon Z\) term; the model adds an extra \(\frac{\epsilon}{2}\) (the "1" inside the parentheses), which is not present in the ground truth.

5. The model's \(\frac{\mu D_{xy}}{4 m_2} (Z - m_2 - 4)\) term is not obviously equivalent to the ground truth's two separate terms involving \(\mu D_{xy}\). The ground truth has \(\frac{1}{2} \frac{\mu D_{xy}}{m_2} Z\) inside the first big parenthesis and a separate subtraction term \(- \mu D_{xy} \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{m_2} \right)\). The model's term is a different combination and includes constants like \(-4\) which do not appear in the ground truth.

6. Overall, the model expression is structurally different, missing a key summation term, and has different coefficients and constants.

---

**Conclusion:**

The model expression is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth. It misses the summation term entirely and has different coefficients and constants in the other terms. This is more than one minor error.

\subsection*{Problem 6 (Paper: 2506.19617v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a system composed of two clusters of $N$ mobile R\"ossler chaotic oscillators. The internal dynamics of the $i^{th}$ oscillator in the first cluster are described by the state variables ${\left( {{x^{1}_i}\left( t \right),\,{x^{2}_i}\left( t \right),\,{x^{3}_i}\left( t \right)} \right)}$, and similarly, for the second cluster, the state variables are ${\left( {{y^{1}_i}\left( t \right),\,{y^{2}_i}\left( t \right),\,{y^{3}_i}\left( t \right)} \right)}$. The dynamics are given by:
For the first cluster:
$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\dot x_i^1 =  - x_i^2 - x_i^3\\
\dot x_i^2 = x_i^1 + ax_i^2 + {\epsilon }\sum\limits_{j = 1}^N {g_{ij}^1(t)\left( {x_j^2 - x_i^2} \right)} + \mu {D_{xy}}\left( {\overline {y}^2   - x_i^2} \right) \\
\dot x_i^3 = b + x_i^3\left( {x_i^1 - c} \right)
\end{array} \right.
$$
For the second cluster:
$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\dot y_i^1 =  - y_i^2 - y_i^3\\
\dot y_i^2 = y_i^1 + ay_i^2 + {\epsilon }\sum\limits_{j = 1}^N {g_{ij}^2(t)\left( {y_j^2 - y_i^2} \right)} + \mu {D_{yx}}\left( {\overline {x}^2   - y_i^2} \right) \\
\dot y_i^3 = b + y_i^3\left( {y_i^1 - c} \right)
\end{array} \right.
$$
Here, $\epsilon$ is the intra-cluster coupling coefficient, and $\mu$ is the inter-cluster coupling coefficient. $\overline{x}^2 = \frac{1}{m_1}\sum_{j=1}^{m_1} g_{ij}^1x_j^2$ and $\overline{y}^2 = \frac{1}{m_2}\sum_{j=1}^{m_2} g_{ij}^2y_j^2$ represent the local centers of mass for the first and second cluster, respectively, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the number of nodes within the vision size in each cluster. The intra-cluster connectivity matrix $g_{ij}^k$ is $1$ if the Euclidean distance $d_{ij}^k$ between agents $i$ and $j$ in cluster $k$ is less than or equal to $d_0^k$, and $0$ otherwise. The inter-cluster connectivity functions $D_{XY}$ and $D_{YX}$ are $1$ if the Euclidean distance $s_{XY}$ between the centers of mass of the two clusters is less than or equal to $s_0$, and $0$ otherwise. For this problem, assume $D_{XY} = D_{YX} = 1$.

To analyze the stability of synchronization between the clusters, an error system $e_i^k = x_i^k - y_i^k$ is defined for $k=1,2,3$ and $i=1,2,...,N$. The error system equations are:
$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\dot e_i^1 =  - e_i^2 - e_i^3\\
\dot e_i^2 = e_i^1 + ae_i^2 + \epsilon \sum\limits_j^N {{g_{ij}^1\left( {e_j^2 - e_i^2} \right) }} + \epsilon {f_{1i}} + \mu {D_{xy}}\left[ { - e_i^2 - \frac{1}{{{m_2}}}\sum\limits_j^{{m_2}} {g _{ij}^2e_j^2}  + {f_{2i}}} \right]\\
\dot e_i^3 =  - ce_i^3 + e_i^1y_i^3 + e_i^3y_i^1
\end{array} \right.
$$
where ${f_{1i}} = \sum\limits_j^{{N}} {\left( {g_{ij}^1 - g_{ij}^2} \right)\left( {y_j^2 - y_i^2} \right)}$ and ${f_{2i}} = \frac{1}{{{m_1}}}\sum\limits_j^{{m_1}} {g _{ij}^1y_j^2}  - \frac{1}{{{m_2}}}\sum\limits_j^{{m_2}} {g _{ij}^2y_j^2}$. For the purpose of this derivation, the non-linear term ${e^1_i}{e^3_i}$ in $\dot e_i^3$ is disregarded due to its negligible size.

A Lyapunov function candidate $V_i$ is defined as:
$$
{V_i} = \frac{1}{2}\left( {{{\left( {e_i^1} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {e_i^2} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {e_i^3} \right)}^2}} \right) + \int\limits_0^t {\left( {{\gamma _1}{{\left( {e_i^1} \right)}^2} + {\gamma _2}{{\left( {e_i^3} \right)}^2}} \right)dt}
$$
The time derivative of this Lyapunov function candidate is given by:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
{{\dot V}_i} = \left( {-1 + y_i^3} \right)e_i^1e_i^3 + a{\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2} - c{\left( {e_i^3} \right)^2} + y_i^1{\left( {e_i^3} \right)^2} + {\gamma _1}{\left( {e_i^1} \right)^2}\\
 - {\gamma _1}{\left( {e_i^1\left( 0 \right)} \right)^2} + {\gamma _2}{\left( {e_i^3} \right)^2} - {\gamma _2}{\left( {e_i^3\left( 0 \right)} \right)^2} + \epsilon \sum\limits_{j \ne i}^N {g_{ij}^1e_j^2e_i^2}  - \\
\epsilon {\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2}\sum\limits_{j \ne i}^N {g_{ij}^1}  + e_i^2\epsilon {{f_{1i}}}  - \mu {D_{xy}}\left( {1 + \frac{1}{{{m_2}}}} \right){\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2} - \\
\frac{{\mu {D_{xy}}}}{{2{m_2}}}\sum\limits_j^{{m_2}} {g _{ij}^2e_j^2e_i^2}  + e_i^2\mu {D_{xy}}{f_{2i}}
\end{array}
$$
Let $y_m^1 = \max\left| {y_i^1} \right|$ and $y_m^3 = \max\left| {y_i^3} \right|$. Applying the inequality $\left| a \right|\left| b \right| \le \frac{1}{2}\left( {{a^2} + {b^2}} \right)$ to maximize the derivative yields:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
{{\dot V}_i} \le \frac{1}{2}\left( {1 + y_m^3} \right){\left( {e_i^1} \right)^2} + \,\left( {y_m^1 - c + \frac{1}{2}\left( {1 + y_m^3} \right)} \right){\left( {e_i^3} \right)^2} +\\

\end{array}
$$
Assume that all $m_2$ oscillators within the visual size are inherently connected to oscillator $i$, such that the degree of this node is naturally $m_2$, which implies $\frac{1}{{4{m_2}}}\sum\limits_{\scriptstyle j = 1,\hfill\atop \scriptstyle j \ne i\hfill}^{{m_2}} {g _{ij}^2} = \frac{1}{4}$.
Assume there exist real positive constants $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ such that $\sum\limits_{\scriptstyle j = 1,\hfill\atop \scriptstyle j \ne i\hfill}^N {g_{ij}^1{{\left( {e_j^2} \right)}^2}} \le {Z_1}{\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2}$ and $\sum\limits_{\scriptstyle j = 1,\hfill\atop \scriptstyle j \ne i\hfill}^N {g _{ij}^2{{\left( {e_j^2} \right)}^2}} \le {Z_2}{\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2}$. Let $Z = \max\left( {Z_1, Z_2} \right)$. This leads to the bound:
$$
\left[ {\frac{\epsilon }{2}{Z_1} + \frac{{\mu {D_{xy}}}}{{2{m_2}}}{Z_2}} \right]{\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2} \le \left[ {\frac{\epsilon }{2} + \frac{{\mu {D_{xy}}}}{{2{m_2}}}} \right]Z{\left( {e_i^2} \right)^2}.
$$
Set the parameters ${\gamma _1} = \frac{1}{2}\left( {1 + y_m^3} \right)$ and ${\gamma _2} = y_m^1 - c + \frac{1}{2}\left( {1 + y_m^3} \right)$. Let $\gamma  = \max\left( {{\gamma _1},\,{\gamma _2}} \right)$ and $\|e_i\|^2 = (e_i^1)^2 + (e_i^2)^2 + (e_i^3)^2$.

Task:
Using the provided expressions and assumptions, derive the upper bound for the time derivative of the Lyapunov function candidate, $\dot{V}_i$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

Let's analyze the two expressions term-by-term.

**Ground Truth Expression:**

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\dot{V}_i \le 2\gamma \|e_i\|^2 - \gamma \|e_i(0)\|^2 + \frac{\epsilon}{2} (f_{1i})^2 + \frac{\mu D_{xy}}{2} (f_{2i})^2 + \\

\end{array}
\]

---

**Model-Generated Expression:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{V}_i \le & \gamma \left[(e_i^1)^2 + (e_i^3)^2\right] \\
& + \left[ a + \frac{\epsilon}{2} - \mu \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{m_2} - \frac{1}{4}\right) - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \sum_{j \neq i} g_{ij}^1 + \left(\frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\mu}{2 m_2}\right) Z \right] (e_i^2)^2 \\
& + \frac{\epsilon}{2} f_{1i}^2 + \frac{\mu}{2} f_{2i}^2 - \gamma_1 (e_i^1(0))^2 - \gamma_2 (e_i^3(0))^2
\end{aligned}
\]

---

**Detailed Comparison:**

1. **Terms involving \(\|e_i\|^2\) and \(\|e_i(0)\|^2\):**

- Ground truth: \(2 \gamma \|e_i\|^2 - \gamma \|e_i(0)\|^2\).

- Model: \(\gamma[(e_i^1)^2 + (e_i^3)^2] - \gamma_1 (e_i^1(0))^2 - \gamma_2 (e_i^3(0))^2\).

- The ground truth uses the norm squared \(\|e_i\|^2\), presumably including components \(e_i^1, e_i^2, e_i^3\), but the model only includes \(e_i^1\) and \(e_i^3\) in the first term and excludes \(e_i^2\).

- The ground truth has a single \(\gamma\) coefficient for the initial error norm squared, while the model splits it into \(\gamma_1\) and \(\gamma_2\).

- The factor of 2 in front of \(\gamma \|e_i\|^2\) in the ground truth is missing in the model (model has \(\gamma\) only).

- The model does not include the initial error term for \(e_i^2(0)\).

2. **Terms involving \(f_{1i}^2\) and \(f_{2i}^2\):**

- Ground truth: \(\frac{\epsilon}{2} (f_{1i})^2 + \frac{\mu D_{xy}}{2} (f_{2i})^2\).

- Model: \(\frac{\epsilon}{2} f_{1i}^2 + \frac{\mu}{2} f_{2i}^2\).

- The model is missing the factor \(D_{xy}\) multiplying \(\mu\) in the \(f_{2i}^2\) term.

3. **Coefficient of \((e_i^2)^2\):**

- Ground truth:

\[
a + \frac{1}{2} \left( \epsilon + \frac{\mu D_{xy}}{m_2} \right) Z - \mu D_{xy} \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{m_2} \right) - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \sum_{j \neq i} g_{ij}^1
\]

- Model:

\[
a + \frac{\epsilon}{2} - \mu \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{m_2} - \frac{1}{4} \right) - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \sum_{j \neq i} g_{ij}^1 + \left( \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\mu}{2 m_2} \right) Z
\]

- Differences:

  - The model has an extra \(\frac{\epsilon}{2}\) term outside the \(Z\) term, which is not present in the ground truth.

  - The model's \(\mu\) term inside the parentheses is \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{m_2} - \frac{1}{4}\), whereas the ground truth has \(\mu D_{xy} \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{m_2} \right)\).

  - The model is missing the factor \(D_{xy}\) multiplying \(\mu\) in these terms.

  - The \(Z\) term in the model is \(\left( \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\mu}{2 m_2} \right) Z\), while the ground truth has \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \epsilon + \frac{\mu D_{xy}}{m_2} \right) Z\).

  - Again, the model is missing \(D_{xy}\) in the \(\mu\) term.

4. **Summary of discrepancies:**

- Missing factor \(D_{xy}\) in all \(\mu\)-related terms in the model.

- The model splits \(\gamma\) into \(\gamma_1\) and \(\gamma_2\) and only includes \(e_i^1\) and \(e_i^3\) components, missing \(e_i^2\).

- The factor 2 in front of \(\gamma \|e_i\|^2\) is missing in the model.

- The model has an extra \(\frac{\epsilon}{2}\) term in the coefficient of \((e_i^2)^2\) outside the \(Z\) term.

- The model has a \(-\frac{1}{4}\) inside the \(\mu\) parentheses, which is not in the ground truth.

---

**Conclusion:**

The model-generated expression has multiple minor but significant errors:

- Missing \(D_{xy}\) factors in \(\mu\)-terms.

- Incorrect coefficients and extra terms in the \((e_i^2)^2\) coefficient.

- Missing factor 2 in the \(\gamma \|e_i\|^2\) term.

- Splitting \(\gamma\) into \(\gamma_1\) and \(\gamma_2\) and missing \(e_i^2\) terms.

These are more than one minor error, and the expression is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth.

---

**Score: 0**

---

**Justification:**

The model expression is not equivalent to the ground truth. It misses key multiplicative factors (\(D_{xy}\)) in multiple terms, has incorrect coefficients, and omits some components of the error vector. These errors are more than minor and prevent the expression from being considered nearly correct.

\subsection*{Problem 7 (Paper: 2506.20163v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
A simplicial complex is a mathematical structure built by attaching simplices (nodes, links, triangles, etc.) by their faces. A $0$-simplex is a node, and a $1$-simplex is a link. For a network consisting of $N_n$ nodes and $N_l$ links, the boundary operator $\mathbf{B}_1$ is an $N_n \times N_l$ matrix that maps $1$-simplices to $0$-simplices. Its elements are defined as $\mathbf{B}_1(i,j)=1$ if the $i$-th $0$-simplex is a face of the $j$-th $1$-simplex with the same orientation, $-1$ if with opposite orientation, and $0$ otherwise. Topological signals (or cochains) are functions defined on simplices. A $0$-cochain $\vec{u}$ is a column vector of dimension $N_n$ representing signals on nodes, and a $1$-cochain $\vec{v}$ is a column vector of dimension $N_l$ representing signals on links. The topological spinor is defined as $\vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix} \vec{u} \\ \vec{v} \end{bmatrix}$. The Dirac-Bianconi operator $\mathcal{D}$ couples cochains of adjacent dimensions and is given by $\mathcal{D} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \mathbf{B}_1 \\ \mathbf{B}_1^{\top} & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. The dynamics of a Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator, where oscillations are induced by this coupling, are generally described by $\dot{\vec{w}}=\vec{F}(\vec{w},\mathcal{D}\vec{w})$, which expands to $\begin{bmatrix} \dot{\vec{u}}\\\dot{\vec{v}} \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \vec{f}(\vec{u},\boldsymbol{B}_1 \vec{v})\\ \vec{g}(\vec{v},\boldsymbol{B}_1^\top \vec{u}) \end{bmatrix}$.
Consider a specific Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator, inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, with $N_n=3$ nodes and $N_l=3$ links. The dynamics of its $0$-cochains $u_i$ and $1$-cochains $v_j$ are given by:
$\dot{u}_i=u_i-u_i^3-(\boldsymbol{B}_1\vec{v})_i+I_i$
$\dot{v}_j=\delta_j((\boldsymbol{B}_1^\top\vec{u})_j-b_jv_j+\alpha_j a_j)$
Here, $I_i, \delta_j, b_j, a_j$ are constant parameters, and $\alpha_j$ is a coefficient that accounts for the change of orientation of the $j$-th link. For this specific system, the boundary operator $\boldsymbol{B}_1$ is given by:
$\boldsymbol{B}_1=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 &-1 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$.
Assume $\alpha_j=1$ for all $j$.

Task:
Derive the full system of six coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of the Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator for the given network structure and boundary operator.

\subsection*{Problem 8 (Paper: 2506.20163v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator, a system where dynamical variables are defined on nodes ($0$-cochains, denoted by $\vec{u} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_n}$) and links ($1$-cochains, denoted by $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_l}$) of a network. The state of the system is described by the topological spinor $\vec{w}=(\vec{u}^\top , \vec{v}^\top)^\top$, which has dimension $N_n+N_l$. The dynamics of this system, known as the Dirac-Bianconi FitzHugh-Nagumo (DBFHN) model, is given by:
$$
\begin{cases}
    \dot{u}_i=u_i-u_i^3-(\boldsymbol{B}_1\vec{v})_i+I_i,  \quad \text{for } i=1,...,N_n \\
    \dot{v}_j=\delta_j((\boldsymbol{B}_1^\top\vec{u})_j-b_jv_j+\alpha_j a_j), \quad \text{for } j=1,...,N_l
\end{cases}
$$
Here, $\boldsymbol{B}_1$ is the $N_n \times N_l$ boundary operator matrix, and $\boldsymbol{B}_1^\top$ is its transpose (the coboundary operator). The terms $(\boldsymbol{B}_1\vec{v})_i$ and $(\boldsymbol{B}_1^\top\vec{u})_j$ represent the $i$-th component of the vector $\boldsymbol{B}_1\vec{v}$ and the $j$-th component of the vector $\boldsymbol{B}_1^\top\vec{u}$, respectively. The parameters $I_i, \delta_j, b_j, a_j, \alpha_j$ are constants. The dynamics can be compactly written as $\dot{\vec{w}} = \vec{F}(\vec{w})$. The Jacobian matrix $J(\vec{w})$ of the vector field $\vec{F}(\vec{w})$ is defined by its elements $J_{ab} = \frac{\partial F_a}{\partial w_b}$, where $F_a$ is the $a$-th component of $\vec{F}(\vec{w})$ and $w_b$ is the $b$-th component of $\vec{w}$. The vector $\vec{w}$ is ordered such that its first $N_n$ components are $u_1, ..., u_{N_n}$ and its next $N_l$ components are $v_1, ..., v_{N_l}$.

Derive the full $(N_n+N_l) \times (N_n+N_l)$ Jacobian matrix $J(\vec{w})$ for the Dirac-Bianconi FitzHugh-Nagumo (DBFHN) model, expressing it in terms of $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$, the boundary operator $\boldsymbol{B}_1$, and the model parameters.

\end{pmatrix}
\]

Comparison:

- The top-left block in the ground truth is a diagonal matrix with entries \(1 - 3u_i^2\). The model uses \(\boldsymbol{D}_u\), presumably representing the same diagonal matrix. This is acceptable if \(\boldsymbol{D}_u = \text{diag}(1-3u_1^2, ..., 1-3u_{N_n}^2)\).

- The top-right block is \(-\boldsymbol{B}_1\) in both expressions, matching exactly.

- The bottom-left block is \(\text{diag}(\delta_i) \boldsymbol{B}_1^\top\) in the ground truth, and \(\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{B}_1^\top\) in the model. Assuming \(\boldsymbol{\Delta} = \text{diag}(\delta_1, ..., \delta_{N_l})\), this matches.

- The bottom-right block is \(-\text{diag}(\delta_i b_i)\) in the ground truth, but the model writes \(-\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{B}\).

Here is the key discrepancy:

- The ground truth has a diagonal matrix with entries \(\delta_i b_i\).

- The model uses \(\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{B}\), which is a product of a diagonal matrix \(\boldsymbol{\Delta}\) and a matrix \(\boldsymbol{B}\). This is not necessarily diagonal, and \(\boldsymbol{B}\) is not specified as diagonal or equal to \(\text{diag}(b_i)\).

- Also, the ground truth uses \(\boldsymbol{B}_1\) in the top-right and bottom-left blocks, but the model uses \(\boldsymbol{B}\) in the bottom-right block, which is inconsistent.

Therefore, the bottom-right block in the model expression is not equivalent to the ground truth.

Since this is more than a minor error (it changes the structure from diagonal to a general matrix product and changes the matrix from \(\boldsymbol{B}_1\) to \(\boldsymbol{B}\)), the model expression is not fully correct.

However, the rest of the expression is correct or matches the ground truth.

Given that there is one significant error (bottom-right block), the score should be 0.

\subsection*{Problem 9 (Paper: 2506.20572v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a network of channels represented by an undirected graph where $(i,j) \in E$ denotes an edge connecting node $i$ to node $j$. Fluid flows through these channels with a flux $Q_{ij}$ along an edge of length $L_{ij}$ and conductivity $D_{ij}$. The dissipated energy per unit time in this network, denoted by $\mathcal{P}$, is given by the sum over all edges:
$$ \mathcal{P} = \sum_{(i,j)\in E}\frac{Q_{ij}^2 L_{ij}}{D_{ij}} $$
Each channel $(i,j)$ has a volume $V_{ij} = \beta L_{ij}\sqrt{D_{ij}}$, where $\beta$ is a constant related to the fluid properties. The total fluid volume in the network, $V = \sum_{(i,j)\in E} V_{ij}$, is conserved and remains constant. The function $g(Q_{ij})$, which describes the elasticity of the channels, is obtained by minimizing the dissipated energy $\mathcal{P}$ with respect to the conductivities $D_{ij}$, subject to the constraint that the total fluid volume $V$ is constant.

Task:
Derive the analytical expression for the function $g(Q_{ij})$.

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is simply \( g(Q_{ij}) = Q_{ij}^{2/3} \).

The model-generated expression is:
\[
g(Q_{ij}) = D_{ij} = \left(\frac{V}{\beta \sum_{(k,l) \in E} L_{kl} Q_{kl}^{2/3}}\right)^2 Q_{ij}^{4/3}
\]

This is a much more complicated expression involving additional variables \(V\), \(\beta\), \(L_{kl}\), and a summation over edges \(E\). It also raises \(Q_{ij}\) to the power \(4/3\) instead of \(2/3\), and includes a squared prefactor.

Since the model-generated expression is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expression, and contains multiple differences (extra factors, different powers, summation terms), it cannot be considered partially correct.

\subsection*{Problem 11 (Paper: 2506.21061v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a quantum many-body system of $N=16$ qubits arranged in a $4 \times 4$ square lattice. The system's dynamics are governed by a 2D spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XY model Hamiltonian, given by $\hat H = \sum _{<i,j>}J_{ij}(\hat\sigma_i^+\hat\sigma_j^-+\mathrm{h.c.})$, where $J_{ij}$ are nearest-neighbor coupling strengths, $\hat\sigma^\pm = (\hat\sigma^x \pm i\hat\sigma^y)/2$ are raising/lowering operators, and $\hat\sigma^x, \hat\sigma^y, \hat\sigma^z$ are Pauli matrices. This Hamiltonian conserves the total spin, meaning the operator $\hat S_z = \sum_j \hat\sigma_j^z$ commutes with $\hat H$. The system is initialized in a half-filling product state $\ket{\Psi_0} = \ket{0101...01}$, where the qubits are ordered such that the first qubit is in state $\ket{0}$, the second in $\ket{1}$, and so on. After evolving for a time $t$, the system is in the state $\ket{\Psi(t)}=e^{-i\hat H t/\hbar }\ket{\Psi_0}$. The system is partitioned into a local subsystem A consisting of two qubits, Q$_5$ and Q$_6$, and its complement B, which includes all other qubits. A projected ensemble is formed by performing projective measurements on subsystem B in the computational basis $\ket{z_\mathrm{B}}$, where $z_\mathrm{B}$ is a bit-string outcome. The quantum state of subsystem A, conditioned on the measurement outcome $z_\mathrm{B}$, is denoted as $\ket{\Psi_{\mathrm{A}}(t,z_\mathrm{B})}$. The half-filling sector of the projected ensemble is defined by outcomes $z_\mathrm{B}$ where the total number of excitations (number of '1's) in subsystem B, denoted $n(z_\mathrm{B})$, is 7. Recall that $\hat\sigma^z \ket{0} = -\ket{0}$ and $\hat\sigma^z \ket{1} = \ket{1}$.

Task:
Determine the general form of the projected state $\ket{\Psi_{\mathrm{A}}(t,z_\mathrm{B})}$ for any $z_\mathrm{B}$ belonging to the half-filling sector of the projected ensemble.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is a linear combination of two basis states with coefficients \(\alpha(t,z_B)\) and \(\beta(t,z_B)\), without any normalization factor explicitly included.

The model-generated expression includes the same linear combination but divides by the normalization factor \(\sqrt{|\alpha(t,z_B)|^2 + |\beta(t,z_B)|^2}\), effectively normalizing the state vector.

Since quantum states are typically normalized, the model's expression is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expression up to a normalization factor. The ground truth expression may be implicitly normalized or just written in an unnormalized form.

Given that the model's expression is a normalized version of the ground truth, it is mathematically equivalent and correct, just more explicit.

Therefore, the model-generated expression matches the ground truth expression in form and meaning, with the only difference being the explicit normalization.

\subsection*{Problem 12 (Paper: 2506.21061v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a quantum many-body system partitioned into a local subsystem A and its complement B. For a quantum state $\ket{\Psi}$, the wave function can be expressed as $\ket{\Psi} = \sum _{z_\mathrm{B}}\sqrt{p(z_\mathrm{B})}\ket{\Psi_{\mathrm{A}}(z_\mathrm{B})}\otimes \ket{z_\mathrm{B}}$, where $\ket{z_{\mathrm{B}}}$ is a measurement basis for B, and $p(z_\mathrm{B})$ is the probability of measuring the bit-string $z_\mathrm{B}$. The state of subsystem A, conditioned on the measurement outcome $z_\mathrm{B}$ for subsystem B, is described by the density matrix $\hat \rho_{\mathrm{A}}(z_\mathrm{B})$. The ensemble-averaged entropy $\bar E_\mathrm{A}$ is defined as $\bar E_\mathrm{A} = -\sum_{z_\mathrm{B}} p(z_\mathrm{B})\ln\text{Tr}\hat \rho_{\mathrm{A}}^2(z_\mathrm{B})$. For a pure state $\hat \rho_{\mathrm{A}}(z_\mathrm{B})$, its purity $\text{Tr}\hat \rho_{\mathrm{A}}^2(z_\mathrm{B}) = 1$, which implies $\bar E_\mathrm{A} = 0$ if all $\hat \rho_{\mathrm{A}}(z_\mathrm{B})$ are pure. When the system is coupled to the environment, the states $\hat \rho_{\mathrm{A}}(z_\mathrm{B})$ become mixed, and $\text{Tr}\hat \rho_{\mathrm{A}}^2(z_\mathrm{B}) < 1$, leading to $\bar E_\mathrm{A} > 0$. Assume that for small information leakage, the state of the entire system at time $t$ can be approximated as $\hat \rho(t) \approx \ket{\Psi(t)}\bra{\Psi(t)} + \delta \hat \rho(t)$, where $\delta \hat \rho(t)$ is a small perturbation due to noise. For small evolution times $t$, the entropy of the entire system, $S(t) = -\text{Tr}(\hat \rho(t)\ln \hat \rho(t))$, can be approximated by $S(t) \approx t/\tau_S$, where $\tau_S$ is a characteristic time scale for entropy generation. Furthermore, assume that for weak and uniform noise across the system, the purity of the projected states, $\text{Tr}\hat \rho_{\mathrm{A}}^2(z_\mathrm{B})$, is approximately independent of $z_\mathrm{B}$ and can be denoted by a time-dependent function $P(t)$. For small leakage, $P(t)$ can be expressed as $P(t) \approx 1 - \epsilon(t)$, where $\epsilon(t)$ is a small, positive quantity. The purity of the entire system, $\text{Tr}(\hat \rho^2(t))$, is approximately $1 - S(t)$ for small leakage. Finally, assume that $\epsilon(t)$ is proportional to $S(t)$, and that $\bar E_\mathrm{A}$ can be expressed in the form $E_0 \frac{t}{\tau_\mathrm{MB}}$, where $E_0$ is a steady-state value of $\bar E_\mathrm{A}$ and $\tau_{\text{MB}}$ is a characteristic decoherence time for the many-body system.

Derive the approximate expression for the ensemble-averaged entropy $\bar E_\mathrm{A}$ for small evolution times $t$, in terms of $E_0$, $t$, and $\tau_{\text{MB}}$.

\subsection*{Problem 13 (Paper: 2506.21156v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a quantum system of $L$ qubits arranged in a chain with periodic boundary conditions, where $L=2\ell$ for $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. The system's dynamics are governed by the PXP Hamiltonian, which in the qubit basis is given by $H_{\text{PXP}} = \sum_{i=1}^L P_{(i-1) \bmod L}X_{i}P_{(i+1) \bmod L}$, where $P_i = \ket{0}\bra{0}$ is the projector to the $\ket{0}$ state, and $X_i=\ket{0}\bra{1}+\ket{1}\bra{0}$ is the Pauli X operator acting on the $i^{\text{th}}$ site. Due to the Rydberg blockade mechanism, adjacent atoms cannot simultaneously occupy $\ket{1}$ states, meaning states with consecutive $|1\rangle$s are forbidden.

To simplify the analysis, we can map two consecutive qubits to a single qutrit using the correspondence $|\iota_1 \iota_2\rangle \equiv |\underline{2\iota_1 + \iota_2}\rangle$, where $\iota_1, \iota_2 \in \{0,1\}$. The qutrit states are $|\underline{0}\rangle \equiv |00\rangle$, $|\underline{1}\rangle \equiv |01\rangle$, $|\underline{2}\rangle \equiv |10\rangle$, and $|\underline{3}\rangle \equiv |11\rangle$. Given the physical constraint, the $|\underline{3}\rangle$ state is forbidden. In this qutrit representation, the PXP Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of Gell-Mann matrices, and further decomposed into a linear part, $H_{\text{PXP,lin}}$, and a residual part, $H_{\text{PXP,res}}$. For the purpose of analyzing the "arch" structure of the Lanczos coefficients, we consider only the linear part of the Hamiltonian, which is given by:
$H_{\text{PXP,lin}} = \sum_{i=1}^{\ell} \left[ \left( E_{\alpha}+ E_{-\alpha} \right)_{i} + \left( E_{\beta}+ E_{-\beta} \right)_{i} \right]$, where $E_{\alpha} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, $E_{-\alpha} = E_{\alpha}^{\dagger}$, $E_{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, and $E_{-\beta} = E_{\beta}^{\dagger}$. These operators act on the qutrit states as defined by the mapping: $a |\underline{2}\rangle+ b|\underline{0}\rangle +c |\underline{1}\rangle \fallingdotseq \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}$.

We are interested in the time evolution of an initial state $|\Psi_0\rangle$ under $H_{\text{PXP,lin}}$. The Lanczos algorithm constructs an orthonormal Krylov basis $|K_n\rangle$ from $|\Psi_0\rangle$ by iteratively applying the Hamiltonian: $|A_{n+1}\rangle = (H-a_n)|K_n\rangle - b_n|K_{n-1}\rangle$, with $|K_n\rangle = b_n^{-1}|A_n\rangle$, $a_n = \langle K_n|H|K_n\rangle$, and $b_n^2 = \langle A_n|A_n\rangle$. For the PXP Hamiltonian acting on product states, all diagonal Lanczos coefficients $a_n$ are zero. The off-diagonal Lanczos coefficients $b_m$ can be determined from the inner products of iterated Hamiltonian actions: $b_m = \left[ \frac{ \langle K_0 | (H_{\text{PXP,lin}}^-)^m (H_{\text{PXP,lin}}^+)^m | K_0 \rangle }{ \langle K_0 | (H_{\text{PXP,lin}}^-)^{m-1} (H_{\text{PXP,lin}}^+)^{m-1} | K_0 \rangle } \right]^{1/2}$, where $H_{\text{PXP,lin}} = H_{\text{PXP,lin}}^+ + H_{\text{PXP,lin}}^-$.

Consider the initial state $|Z_k\rangle = |\dots {1}\underbrace{{0}\dots {0}}_{k-1}\,{1}\dots\rangle$, which in the qutrit representation can be approximated as a product of two simpler product states: $|Z_k' \rangle \equiv |\underline{2} \rangle^{\otimes n_2} \otimes |\underline{0} \rangle^{\otimes n_0}$, where $n_2 = \ell \cdot \frac{2}{k}$ and $n_0 = \ell \cdot \frac{k-2}{k}$.
For a state $|\underline{2}\rangle^{\otimes n}$, the relevant ladder operators are $H_{\text{PXP,lin}}^{(2,n,+)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( E_{-\alpha} + E_{-\beta} \right)_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sum_{i=1}^n (J_-)_i$, where $(J_-)_i$ are spin-1 lowering operators. The Lanczos coefficients for this case are $b_m^{(2,n)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} m (2n-m+1)}$.
For a state $|\underline{0}\rangle^{\otimes n}$, the relevant ladder operators are $H_{\text{PXP,lin}}^{(0,n,+)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( E_{\alpha} + E_{-\beta} \right)_i$. The Lanczos coefficients for this case are $b_m^{(0,n)} = \sqrt{2 m (n-m+1)}$.

The model-generated expression for \( b_m \) is a much simpler closed-form expression involving a square root of a product of terms, including \( m \), \( \ell \), and \( k \), but it does not resemble the sum-of-factorials form at all. It also includes a domain specification for \( m \).

Since the model expression is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expression, and it does not match the structure or form of the ground truth, it cannot be considered correct or even partially correct. The model expression appears to be a different formula entirely.

Therefore, the model expression is incorrect.

Background:
The PXP Hamiltonian describes a system of $L$ qubits arranged in a chain with periodic boundary conditions, given by $H_{\text{PXP}} = \sum_{i=1}^L P_{(i-1) \bmod L}X_{i}P_{(i+1) \bmod L}$, where $P_i = \ket{0}\bra{0}$ is the projector to the $\ket{0}$ state and $X_i=\ket{0}\bra{1}+\ket{1}\bra{0}$ is the Pauli X operator acting on the $i^{\text{th}}$ site. Due to the Rydberg blockade mechanism, adjacent qubits cannot simultaneously occupy the $\ket{1}$ state. This constraint implies that states like $|11\rangle$ are forbidden.

For an even lattice size $L=2\ell$, the system can be effectively described using $\ell$ qutrits, where each qutrit corresponds to two consecutive qubits. The qutrit states are defined as $|\underline{0}\rangle \equiv |00\rangle$, $|\underline{1}\rangle \equiv |01\rangle$, and $|\underline{2}\rangle \equiv |10\rangle$. The forbidden $|11\rangle$ state corresponds to $|\underline{3}\rangle$.

The PXP Hamiltonian can be decomposed into a linear part, $H_{\text{PXP,lin}}$, and a residual part, $H_{\text{PXP,res}}$. The linear part is given by:
$H_{\text{PXP,lin}} = \sum_{i=1}^{\ell} \left[ \left( E_{\alpha}+ E_{-\alpha} \right)_{i} + \left( E_{\beta}+ E_{-\beta} \right)_{i} \right]$,
where $E_{\alpha}, E_{-\alpha}, E_{\beta}, E_{-\beta}$ are generators of the $\mathfrak{s}l_3(\mathbb{C})$ Lie algebra. Their matrix representations in the qutrit basis $\{|\underline{2}\rangle, |\underline{0}\rangle, |\underline{1}\rangle\}$ (corresponding to vector components $a, b, c$ respectively, such that $a |\underline{2}\rangle+ b|\underline{0}\rangle +c |\underline{1}\rangle \fallingdotseq \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}$) are:
$E_{\alpha} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, $E_{-\alpha} = E_{\alpha}^{\dagger} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
$E_{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, $E_{-\beta} = E_{\beta}^{\dagger} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
The sum $\left( E_{\alpha}+ E_{-\alpha} \right)_{i} + \left( E_{\beta}+ E_{-\beta} \right)_{i}$ can be identified with $\sqrt{2} (J_x)_i$, where $(J_x)_i$ is the spin-1 matrix for the $i^{\text{th}}$ qutrit.

The Lanczos algorithm is used to construct an orthonormal Krylov basis $\{|K_m\rangle\}$ from an initial state $|K_0\rangle = |\Psi_0\rangle$ by repeatedly applying the Hamiltonian $H$. The Hamiltonian takes a tri-diagonal form in this basis: $H|K_m\rangle = b_m|K_{m-1}\rangle + a_m|K_m\rangle + b_{m+1}|K_{m+1}\rangle$. For product initial states under the PXP Hamiltonian, all diagonal coefficients $a_m$ are zero. The off-diagonal Lanczos coefficients $b_m$ are given by $b_m = \left[ \frac{ \langle K_0 | (H^-)^m (H^+)^m | K_0 \rangle }{ \langle K_0 | (H^-)^{m-1} (H^+)^{m-1} | K_0 \rangle } \right]^{1/2}$, where $H=H^++H^-$ is a decomposition into raising and lowering operators.

Consider initial states of the form $|Z_k\rangle = |\dots {1}\underbrace{{0}\dots {0}}_{k-1}\,{1}\dots\rangle$, where $k-1 \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. For analytical convenience, we consider a simplified initial state $|Z_k' \rangle \equiv |\underline{2} \rangle^{\otimes N_2} \otimes |\underline{0} \rangle^{\otimes N_0}$, where $N_2 = \ell \cdot \tfrac{2}{k}$ and $N_0 = \ell \cdot \tfrac{k-2}{k}$. The linear PXP Hamiltonian $H_{\text{PXP,lin}}$ acts independently on each qutrit.
The Lanczos coefficients generated by $H_{\text{PXP,lin}}$ acting on a state of $N_2$ qutrits all in $|\underline{2}\rangle$ are $b_m^{(2,N_2)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} m (2N_2-m+1)}$.
The Lanczos coefficients generated by $H_{\text{PXP,lin}}$ acting on a state of $N_0$ qutrits all in $|\underline{0}\rangle$ are $b_m^{(0,N_0)} = \sqrt{2 m (N_0-m+1)}$.

The ground truth expression for \( b_m \) is a complicated ratio of sums involving factorials and powers of 2, all under a square root, multiplied by \(\sqrt{2} m\). It explicitly depends on sums over \( l \) with factorial terms and parameters involving \(\ell\), \(k\), and \(m\).

The model-generated expression for \( b_m \) is a much simpler algebraic expression inside a square root, involving \( m \), \( N_0 \), and \( N_2 \), with no sums, factorials, or the parameters \(\ell\) and \(k\). The structure and form are completely different.

There is no evident equivalence or even a close resemblance between the two expressions. The model expression does not match the ground truth expression in form or content, and it is not a minor variation or simplification of the ground truth. It appears to be a completely different formula.

Therefore, the model-generated expression is incorrect relative to the ground truth.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a quantum system evolving in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Let $P$ be a projection operator onto a subspace $V \subset \mathcal{H}$, and $Q = \mathds{1} - P$ be the complementary projector onto $V^{\perp}$. The system undergoes unitary evolution described by $U(t) = e^{-iHt}$, where $H$ is a time-independent Hamiltonian. We consider an initial quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ such that $\ket{\psi} \in V$, which implies $P\ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}$.

To monitor the quantum system, weak measurements are performed. These measurements are characterized by a coupling strength parameter $\eta \in (0,1]$. The effect of these weak measurements on the system can be described by modified operators $P_{\eta}$ and $Q_{\eta}$, which are related to the standard projection operators $P$ and $Q$ as follows:
$P_{\eta} = \sqrt{\eta}P$
$Q_{\eta} = Q + \sqrt{1-\eta}P$

These operators satisfy a pseudo-completeness relation: $P_{\eta} + Q_{\eta} = \mathds{1} + f(\eta)P$, where $f(\eta) = \sqrt{\eta} + \sqrt{1-\eta} - 1$.
Additionally, define $g(\eta) = 1 - \sqrt{1-\eta}$. Note that $P_{\eta} = \sqrt{\eta}P$ and $\mathds{1} - Q_{\eta} = g(\eta)P$.

The monitoring process involves repeated applications of the unitary evolution followed by a weak measurement. The "weak survival operator" is defined as $\tilde{U}_{\eta}(t) = Q_{\eta}U(t)$.
The "weak first return amplitude operator" $\hat{a}_n^{\eta}(t)$ describes the amplitude for the quantum walker to be detected for the first time at the $n$-th measurement step. It is defined as:
$\hat{a}_n^{\eta}(t) = P_{\eta} U(t) \tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^{n-1} P$ for $n \geq 1$.

For an initial state $\ket{\psi} \in V$, the action of the weak first return amplitude operator can be expressed as:
$\hat{a}_n^{\eta}(t)\ket{\psi} = U(t) \tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^{n-1}\ket{\psi} - \tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^n\ket{\psi} + f(\eta) P U(t) \tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^{n-1}\ket{\psi}$.

The $\eta$-dependent first detection probability $p_n(\eta,t)$ is the probability of detecting the quantum walker at the $n$-th measurement step, given by $p_n(\eta,t) = \norm{\hat{a}_n^{\eta}(t)\ket{\psi}}^2$.

Task:
Derive an analytical expression for the $\eta$-dependent first detection probability $p_n(\eta,t)$ in terms of the norms of the weak survival operator $\tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)$ acting on the initial state $\ket{\psi}$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}

The model-generated expression is:

p_n(\eta ,t) = \|\tilde U_{\eta}(t)^{n-1}\ket{\psi}\|^{2} - \|\tilde U_{\eta}(t)^{n}\ket{\psi}\|^{2}

The ground truth expression is:

p_n(\eta,t) = \norm{\tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^{n-1}\ket{\psi}}^2 - \norm{\tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^n\ket{\psi}}^2

Both expressions are mathematically identical. The only differences are stylistic: the model uses \bigl\| ... \bigr\|^{2} instead of \norm{...}^2, and the spacing is slightly different. These are equivalent notations for the norm squared. The variables and exponents match exactly, and the subtraction order is the same.

Therefore, the model-generated expression is completely correct.

\subsection*{Problem 16 (Paper: 2506.21168v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a continuous-time quantum walk on a finite graph, where the quantum system evolves unitarily under a time-independent Hamiltonian $H$, such that the unitary evolution operator is $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$. The system is monitored stroboscopically at a constant rate, with a time interval $t$ between consecutive measurements. The measurement process is implemented via weak measurements, characterized by a coupling parameter $\eta \in (0,1]$.

Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the Hilbert space of the quantum system. We are interested in the first hitting time to a specific subspace $V \subset \mathcal{H}$. Let $P$ be the projection operator onto $V$, and $Q = \mathds{1}-P$ be the complementary projector onto $V^{\perp}$. For weak measurements, the standard projection operators $P$ and $Q$ are effectively replaced by modified operators $P_{\eta}$ and $Q_{\eta}$, which are defined as $P_{\eta} = \sqrt{\eta}P$ and $Q_{\eta} = Q + \sqrt{1-\eta}P$. The "survival operator" for the weakly monitored quantum walk is defined as $\Tilde{U}_{\eta}(t) := Q_{\eta}U(t)$.

For an initial quantum state $\ket{\psi} \in V$ (i.e., $P\ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}$ and $\norm{\ket{\psi}}=1$), the expected first hitting time after $N$ weak measurements, denoted $\tau_N(\eta,t)$, is given by:
$$
\tau_N(\eta,t) = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\norm{\Tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^k\ket{\psi}}^2 - N \norm{\Tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^N\ket{\psi}}^2}{1-\norm{\Tilde{U}_{\eta}(t)^N\ket{\psi}}^2}
$$
Consider the "Zeno limit," where the time interval between measurements approaches zero, i.e., $t=0$. In this limit, the unitary evolution operator becomes $U(0)=\mathds{1}$.

Task:
Derive the analytical expression for the expected first hitting time $\tau_N(\eta,0)$ in the Zeno limit, for an initial state $\ket{\psi} \in V$.

\subsection*{Problem 17 (Paper: 2506.21173v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
A quantum system is described by a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H} = \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2$. The standard basis for this space is $\mathcal{B} = (\ket{00}, \ket{01}, \ket{10}, \ket{11})$. A time-evolving quantum state (trajectory) $\ket{\Psi(t)}$ is given in this basis by:
$$ \ket{\Psi(t)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \cos(t) \\ \sin(t) \end{pmatrix} $$
for $t \in [0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.
A new tensor product structure (TPS) is defined by a basis $\mathcal{B}' = (\ket{++}, \ket{+-}, \ket{-+}, \ket{--})$, where $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$ are orthonormal basis states for each of the two constituent qubits. This new TPS is related to the standard one by a unitary transformation $U$, such that if a state is represented by a column vector $v$ in basis $\mathcal{B}$, its representation in basis $\mathcal{B}'$ is $Uv$. The unitary matrix $U$ is given by:
$$U = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & i & 0 & i \\ 0 & -i & 0 & i \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
A state is considered a product state in the new TPS if it can be written as $\ket{\Psi_1(t)} \otimes \ket{\Psi_2(t)}$, where $\ket{\Psi_1(t)}$ is a state in the first qubit's Hilbert space and $\ket{\Psi_2(t)}$ is a state in the second qubit's Hilbert space. In the basis $\mathcal{B}'$, a product state $(a\ket{+} + b\ket{-}) \otimes(c\ket{+} + d\ket{-})$ corresponds to the column vector $\begin{pmatrix} ac \\ ad \\ bc \\ bd \end{pmatrix}$.

Task:
Determine the explicit form of the transformed state $\ket{\Psi'(t)}$ in the new basis $\mathcal{B}'$ and express it as a tensor product of two single-qubit states, $\ket{\Psi_1(t)}$ and $\ket{\Psi_2(t)}$, where $\ket{\Psi_1(t)}$ and $\ket{\Psi_2(t)}$ are linear combinations of $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$.

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

Let's analyze the two expressions carefully.

**Ground Truth Expression:**
\[
\frac{e^{-it}}{4} \left[ (e^{it}-1) \ket{+} + (e^{it}+1) \ket{-} \right] \otimes \left[ (e^{it}-1) \ket{+} + (e^{it}+1) \ket{-} \right]
\]

**Model-Generated Expression:**
\[
\ket{\Psi'(t)} = \left(\sin\frac{t}{2} \ket{+} - i \cos\frac{t}{2} \ket{-}\right) \otimes \left(\sin\frac{t}{2} \ket{+} - i \cos\frac{t}{2} \ket{-}\right)
\]

---

**Step 1: Check if the two expressions are mathematically equivalent**

Rewrite the ground truth expression inside the bracket:

\[
(e^{it} - 1) \ket{+} + (e^{it} + 1) \ket{-}
\]

Recall Euler's formula:

\[
e^{it} = \cos t + i \sin t
\]

Calculate each coefficient:

- \(e^{it} - 1 = (\cos t - 1) + i \sin t\)
- \(e^{it} + 1 = (\cos t + 1) + i \sin t\)

Now, factor out \(e^{-it}/4\):

\[
\frac{e^{-it}}{4} \left[ (e^{it} - 1) \ket{+} + (e^{it} + 1) \ket{-} \right]
= \frac{1}{4} \left[ (1 - e^{-it}) \ket{+} + (1 + e^{-it}) \ket{-} \right]
\]

Because \(e^{-it} e^{it} = 1\), multiplying inside the bracket by \(e^{-it}\) shifts the exponentials.

Alternatively, let's try to rewrite the model expression in exponential form to see if it matches.

---

**Step 2: Express the model expression in exponential form**

Recall:

\[
\sin \frac{t}{2} = \frac{e^{i t/2} - e^{-i t/2}}{2i}, \quad \cos \frac{t}{2} = \frac{e^{i t/2} + e^{-i t/2}}{2}
\]

So,

\[
\sin \frac{t}{2} \ket{+} - i \cos \frac{t}{2} \ket{-} = \left(\frac{e^{i t/2} - e^{-i t/2}}{2i}\right) \ket{+} - i \left(\frac{e^{i t/2} + e^{-i t/2}}{2}\right) \ket{-}
\]

Multiply terms:

\[
= \frac{e^{i t/2} - e^{-i t/2}}{2i} \ket{+} - \frac{i e^{i t/2} + i e^{-i t/2}}{2} \ket{-}
\]

Note that \(\frac{1}{i} = -i\), so:

\[
\frac{e^{i t/2} - e^{-i t/2}}{2i} = -\frac{i}{2} (e^{i t/2} - e^{-i t/2}) = -\frac{i e^{i t/2}}{2} + \frac{i e^{-i t/2}}{2}
\]

Therefore,

\[
\sin \frac{t}{2} \ket{+} - i \cos \frac{t}{2} \ket{-} = \left(-\frac{i e^{i t/2}}{2} + \frac{i e^{-i t/2}}{2}\right) \ket{+} - \frac{i e^{i t/2} + i e^{-i t/2}}{2} \ket{-}
\]

Group terms:

\[
= \frac{i}{2} \left( e^{-i t/2} - e^{i t/2} \right) \ket{+} - \frac{i}{2} \left( e^{i t/2} + e^{-i t/2} \right) \ket{-}
\]

Rewrite:

\[
= \frac{i}{2} \left( e^{-i t/2} - e^{i t/2} \right) \ket{+} - \frac{i}{2} \left( e^{i t/2} + e^{-i t/2} \right) \ket{-}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \(e^{i t/2}\) to get terms in \(e^{i t}\):

\[
= \frac{i}{2} e^{-i t/2} (1 - e^{i t}) \ket{+} - \frac{i}{2} e^{-i t/2} (e^{i t} + 1) \ket{-}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{i}{2} e^{-i t/2}\):

\[
= \frac{i}{2} e^{-i t/2} \left[ (1 - e^{i t}) \ket{+} - (e^{i t} + 1) \ket{-} \right]
\]

---

**Step 3: Compare with the ground truth**

Ground truth inside the bracket is:

\[
(e^{i t} - 1) \ket{+} + (e^{i t} + 1) \ket{-}
\]

Model expression inside the bracket is:

\[
(1 - e^{i t}) \ket{+} - (e^{i t} + 1) \ket{-} = - (e^{i t} - 1) \ket{+} - (e^{i t} + 1) \ket{-}
\]

So the model expression is:

\[
\frac{i}{2} e^{-i t/2} \times \left[ - (e^{i t} - 1) \ket{+} - (e^{i t} + 1) \ket{-} \right] = - \frac{i}{2} e^{-i t/2} \left[ (e^{i t} - 1) \ket{+} + (e^{i t} + 1) \ket{-} \right]
\]

The ground truth has a prefactor of \(\frac{e^{-i t}}{4}\), the model has \(- \frac{i}{2} e^{-i t/2}\).

---

**Step 4: Check if the prefactors differ by a global phase and constant**

Note that global phases and overall constants can be factored out in quantum states without changing the physical state.

Calculate the ratio of the prefactors:

\[
\frac{- \frac{i}{2} e^{-i t/2}}{\frac{e^{-i t}}{4}} = -i \times 2 \times e^{i t/2} = -2 i e^{i t/2}
\]

This is a complex number with magnitude 2 and a phase factor.

Since quantum states are defined up to a global phase and normalization, the difference in prefactors is acceptable if the states are normalized.

---

**Step 5: Conclusion**

- The model expression matches the ground truth expression up to a global phase and normalization factor.
- The bracketed terms are the same up to an overall minus sign, which can be absorbed into the global phase.
- The model expression is a tensor product of the same single-qubit state, matching the ground truth's tensor product structure.
- The difference in prefactors is a global phase and normalization factor, which is physically irrelevant.

Therefore, the model expression is **mathematically equivalent** to the ground truth expression.

---

**Final assessment:**

- The model expression is completely correct, modulo global phase and normalization.
- It matches the ground truth expression exactly in form and content.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{H} = \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2$ with a standard basis $\mathcal{B} = (\ket{11}, \ket{12}, \ket{21}, \ket{22})$. Let $\ket{\Psi(t)} = \begin{pmatrix} a(t) \\ b(t) \\ c(t) \\ d(t) \end{pmatrix}$ be a time-evolving quantum state, where $a(t), b(t), c(t), d(t)$ are continuous complex functions for $t \in [0,T]$. Assume that the set of all products of these functions, $\{a(t)^2, b(t)^2, c(t)^2, d(t)^2, a(t)b(t), a(t)c(t), a(t)d(t), b(t)c(t), b(t)d(t), c(t)d(t)\}$, forms a linearly independent set in the space of continuous functions $\mathcal{C}^0([0,T])$.

Suppose there exists a fixed tensor product structure (TPS) $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_1 \otimes \mathcal{H}_2$ that disentangles $\ket{\Psi(t)}$. This TPS is defined by a new orthonormal basis $\mathcal{B}' = (\ket{1'1'}, \ket{1'2'}, \ket{2'1'}, \ket{2'2'})$. Let $U = (u_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq 4}$ be the unitary matrix that maps the standard basis $\mathcal{B}$ to $\mathcal{B}'$, such that $U \ket{j} = \ket{j'}$ for $j \in \{1,2,3,4\}$. The state $\ket{\Psi(t)}$ expressed in the new basis is $\ket{\Psi'(t)} = U \ket{\Psi(t)} = \begin{pmatrix} \Psi'_{11}(t) \\ \Psi'_{12}(t) \\ \Psi'_{21}(t) \\ \Psi'_{22}(t) \end{pmatrix}$. For $\ket{\Psi(t)}$ to be a product state in this new TPS for all $t$, its components in $\mathcal{B}'$ must satisfy the condition $\Psi'_{11}(t) \Psi'_{22}(t) = \Psi'_{12}(t) \Psi'_{21}(t)$ for all $t \in [0,T]$.

Let $a_1(t) = a(t)$, $a_2(t) = b(t)$, $a_3(t) = c(t)$, $a_4(t) = d(t)$. The product state condition can be written as:
$$ \left( \sum_{k=1}^4 u_{1k} a_k(t) \right) \left( \sum_{l=1}^4 u_{4l} a_l(t) \right) = \left( \sum_{k=1}^4 u_{2k} a_k(t) \right) \left( \sum_{l=1}^4 u_{3l} a_l(t) \right) $$
By the linear independence of the products $a_k(t)a_l(t)$, the coefficients of each product term must be equal on both sides of this equation. This implies two sets of conditions on the elements of $U$:
1. For any $j \in \{1,2,3,4\}$: $u_{1j}u_{4j} = u_{2j}u_{3j}$.
2. For any distinct $j, k \in \{1,2,3,4\}$: $u_{1j}u_{4k} + u_{1k}u_{4j} = u_{2j}u_{3k} + u_{2k}u_{3j}$.

Assume that there exists at least one index $j_0 \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ such that $u_{1j_0}u_{4j_0} = u_{2j_0}u_{3j_0} \neq 0$. Without loss of generality, let this index be $j_0=1$. This implies that $u_{11}, u_{21}, u_{31}, u_{41}$ are all non-zero. Define new coefficients $v_{ij} = u_{ij}/u_{i1}$ for $i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $j \in \{1,2,3,4\}$.

Task:
Using the conditions on the coefficients of $U$ derived from the product state requirement and the linear independence assumption, and the definition of $v_{ij}$, derive a simplified algebraic relationship that must hold for $v_{1j}, v_{2j}, v_{3j}, v_{4j}$ for any $j \in \{1,2,3,4\}$.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a network automaton (NA) consisting of $N$ nodes, where each node $v_i$ can be in one of two states, $s(v_i, t) \in \{0, 1\}$, at discrete time step $t$. The state of node $v_i$ at time $t+1$ is determined by a uniform local update rule $\phi(s_i, \rho_i)$, where $s_i = s(v_i, t)$ is the current state of node $v_i$, and $\rho_i = \frac{1}{k_i}\sum_{j}A_{ij}s_j$ is the density of living nodes in $v_i$'s neighborhood. Here, $k_i$ is the degree of node $v_i$, and $A_{ij}$ are elements of the adjacency matrix. The local update rule is defined as:
$$
\phi(s_i, \rho_i) = \begin{cases}
    1, \qquad \text{if } s_i = 0 \text{ and } \rho_i \in \bigcup B,\\
    1, \qquad \text{if } s_i = 1 \text{ and } \rho_i \in \bigcup S,\\
    0, \qquad \text{else}.
\end{cases}
$$
Here, $B$ and $S$ are sets of subintervals of the unit interval, chosen from $R = \{R_j\}_{j=0}^{r-1}$, where $r$ is an odd integer resolution parameter. The intervals $R_j$ are defined as $R_j = \left[\frac{j}{r}, \frac{j+1}{r}\right[$ for $0 \leq j < (r-1)/2$, $R_{(r-1)/2} = \left[\frac{(r-1)}{2r}, \frac{(r+1)}{2r}\right]$, and $R_j = \left]\frac{j}{r}, \frac{j+1}{r}\right]$ for $(r-1)/2 < j \leq r-1$.

We are interested in how a defect propagates through the network. A defect is defined as the bitwise XOR operation on two nearly identical configurations, $s(v_i, t)$ and $s'(v_i, t)$. The normalized Hamming distance between these two configurations at time $t$ is given by $\delta^t = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (s(v_i, t) \oplus s'(v_i, t))$, where $\oplus$ is the XOR operator. We assume that the local topological structure can be ignored, meaning that probabilities of states and toggles follow simple binomial or hypergeometric distributions.

Specifically, for a given global state average $\rho^t = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N s(v_i, t)$ and normalized Hamming distance $\delta^t$ at time $t$, the probabilities are:
- The probability of finding a central node in state $s$ given $\rho^t$: $P(s | \rho^t) = (\rho^t)^s (1-\rho^t)^{1-s}$.
- The probability of finding $q$ living neighbors out of $k$ for a node, given $\rho^t$: $P(q | k, \rho^t) = \binom{k}{q} (\rho^t)^q (1-\rho^t)^{k-q}$.
- The probability that the central node $v_i$ is toggled ($c=1$) or not ($c=0$), given $\delta^t$: $P(c|\delta^t) = (\delta^t)^c (1-\delta^t)^{1-c}$.
- The probability that $d$ neighborhood states are toggled out of $k$ neighbors, given $\delta^t$: $P(d|k,\delta^t) = \binom{k}{d}(\delta^t)^d (1-\delta^t)^{k-d}$.
- The probability that $\tau$ of the $d$ toggles are 'killer toggles' (bit flips from 1 to 0), given $k$, $d$, and $q$ (number of living neighbors in the original configuration): $P(\tau|k, d, q) = \binom{q}{\tau}\binom{k-q}{d-\tau} \bigg/ \binom{k}{d}$, where $\max(0, d+q-k) \leq \tau \leq \min(d,q)$.

The defect of node $v_i$ at time $t+1$, denoted $d_i^{t+1}$, is given by $s(v_i, t+1) \oplus s'(v_i, t+1)$. This can be expressed using the local update rule as:
$\mathcal{D}(k, s, q, c, d, \tau) = \phi\bigg(s, \frac{q}{k}\bigg) \oplus \phi\bigg(s\oplus c, \frac{q-2\tau+d}{k}\bigg)$.
Here, $s$ is the state of the central node in the original configuration, $q$ is the number of living neighbors in the original configuration, $c$ indicates if the central node itself is toggled, $d$ is the number of toggled neighbors, and $\tau$ is the number of killer toggles among the $d$ toggled neighbors.

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is a general summation over probabilities \(P(k)\), \(P(s|\rho^t)\), \(P(q|k,\rho^t)\), \(P(c|\delta^t)\), \(P(d|k,\delta^t)\), and \(P(\tau|k,d,q)\), multiplied by \(\mathcal{D}(k,s,q,c,d,\tau)\).

The model-generated expression explicitly writes out these probabilities assuming specific binomial or Bernoulli forms:

- \(P(s|\rho^t) = (\rho^t)^s (1-\rho^t)^{1-s}\) for \(s \in \{0,1\}\), which is a Bernoulli distribution.
- \(P(q|k,\rho^t) = \binom{k}{q} (\rho^t)^q (1-\rho^t)^{k-q}\), a Binomial distribution.
- \(P(c|\delta^t) = (\delta^t)^c (1-\delta^t)^{1-c}\), Bernoulli.
- \(P(d|k,\delta^t) = \binom{k}{d} (\delta^t)^d (1-\delta^t)^{k-d}\), Binomial.
- \(P(\tau|k,d,q) = \frac{\binom{q}{\tau} \binom{k-q}{d-\tau}}{\binom{k}{d}}\), which is the hypergeometric distribution.

The summation limits also match the ground truth, with the \(\tau\) sum running from \(\max(0, d+q-k)\) to \(\min(d,q)\), which is the correct support for the hypergeometric distribution.

The model-generated expression also includes the expectation notation \(\langle \delta^{t+1} \rangle\), which is consistent with the sum over all these probabilities weighted by \(\mathcal{D}\).

All components correspond exactly to the ground truth expression, just expanded explicitly in terms of binomial and Bernoulli probabilities.

Therefore, the model-generated expression is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth.

\subsection*{Problem 20 (Paper: 2506.21226v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
A Life-like Network Automaton (LLNA) is a discrete dynamical system where $N$ nodes, each with a binary state $s_i \in \{0,1\}$, evolve synchronously on a network. The state of a node $v_i$ at time $t+1$, denoted $s(v_i, t+1)$, is determined by a uniform local outer-totalistic update rule $\phi(s_i, \rho_i)$. Here, $s_i = s(v_i, t)$ is the current state of node $v_i$, and $\rho_i = \frac{1}{k_i}\sum_{j}A_{ij}s_j$ is the density of living nodes in $v_i$'s neighborhood, where $k_i$ is the degree of node $v_i$ and $A_{ij}$ are elements of the adjacency matrix. The network has a degree distribution $P(k)$.

The global state average at time $t$ is $\rho^t = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N s(v_i, t)$. To analyze the propagation of perturbations, we consider two configurations, $s(v_i, t)$ and $s'(v_i, t)$, which are initially nearly identical. The normalized Hamming distance between these configurations at time $t$ is $\delta^t = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \Big( s(v_i, t) \oplus s'(v_i, t) \Big)$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The Derrida plot describes how this distance evolves, mapping $\delta^t$ to the expected normalized Hamming distance at time $t+1$, $\langle\delta^{t+1}\rangle$.

To derive this expectation, we assume that local topological structure can be ignored, allowing us to use simple probabilistic distributions.
The probability of a central node being in state $s$ given the global state average $\rho^t$ is $P(s | \rho^t) = (\rho^t)^s (1-\rho^t)^{1-s}$.
The probability of $q$ living neighbors out of $k$ total neighbors, given $\rho^t$, is $P(q | k, \rho^t) = \binom{k}{q} (\rho^t)^q (1-\rho^t)^{k-q}$.
When comparing two configurations, the probability that the central node $v_i$ is toggled ($c=1$) or not ($c=0$) between the two configurations, given $\delta^t$, is $P(c|\delta^t) = (\delta^t)^c (1-\delta^t)^{1-c}$.
The probability that $d$ out of $k$ neighbors are toggled between the two configurations, given $\delta^t$, is $P(d|k,\delta^t) = \binom{k}{d}(\delta^t)^d (1-\delta^t)^{k-d}$.
Among the $d$ toggled neighbors, let $\tau$ be the number of 'killer toggles' (bit flips from $1$ to $0$). The probability of $\tau$ killer toggles given $k$ neighbors, $d$ toggled neighbors, and $q$ living neighbors in the first configuration, is $P(\tau|k, d, q) = \binom{q}{\tau}\binom{k-q}{d-\tau} \bigg/ \binom{k}{d}$, where $\max(0, d+q-k) \leq \tau \leq \min(d,q)$.

The defect of a single node $v_i$ at time $t+1$, denoted $d_i^{t+1}$, is $s(v_i, t+1) \oplus s'(v_i, t+1)$. This can be expressed as $\mathcal{D}(k, s, q, c, d, \tau) = \phi\bigg(s, \frac{q}{k}\bigg) \oplus \phi\bigg(s\oplus c, \frac{q-2\tau+d}{k}\bigg)$, where $s$ is the state of $v_i$ in the first configuration, $q$ is the number of living neighbors of $v_i$ in the first configuration, $s \oplus c$ is the state of $v_i$ in the second configuration, and $\frac{q-2\tau+d}{k}$ is the density of living neighbors of $v_i$ in the second configuration.

Task:
Derive the analytical expression for the expected normalized Hamming distance at time $t+1$, $\langle\delta^{t+1}\rangle$, by averaging over all nodes and considering the probabilities of different states and toggles.

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is a nested sum over variables \(k, s, q, c, d, \tau\) of the product of probabilities \(P(k)\), \(P(s|\rho^t)\), \(P(q|k,\rho^t)\), \(P(c|\delta^t)\), \(P(d|k,\delta^t)\), \(P(\tau|k,d,q)\) multiplied by a function involving \(\phi\) and XOR operations.

The model-generated expression also sums over the same variables, but it explicitly writes out binomial coefficients and powers of \(\rho^t\) and \(\delta^t\) that presumably correspond to the probabilities \(P(s|\rho^t)\), \(P(q|k,\rho^t)\), \(P(c|\delta^t)\), and \(P(d|k,\delta^t)\). It also includes a factor \(\mathcal{D}(k,s,q,c,d,\tau)\) which is not defined here but presumably corresponds to the \(\phi\)-based function in the ground truth.

Key points of comparison:

- The ground truth expression explicitly shows the XOR and \(\phi\) functions, which are the core of the expected value calculation.
- The model expression replaces the probability terms with explicit binomial distributions and powers, which is consistent with the probabilities in the ground truth if those are binomially distributed.
- The model expression introduces \(\mathcal{D}(k,s,q,c,d,\tau)\) which is not defined here, but presumably encodes the \(\phi\) and XOR terms.
- The model expression sums \(k\) from 0 to \(\infty\), while the ground truth sums over \(k\) without explicit limits (likely over the support of \(P(k)\)).
- The model expression sums \(s, c\) from 0 to 1, consistent with the ground truth.
- The model expression sums \(q, d\) from 0 to \(k\), consistent with the ground truth.
- The model expression sums \(\tau\) from \(\tau_{\min}\) to \(\tau_{\max}\), consistent with the ground truth's sum over \(\tau\).

However, the model expression does not explicitly show the \(\phi\) functions or the XOR operation, instead encapsulating them in \(\mathcal{D}\). Since \(\mathcal{D}\) is undefined, we cannot verify if it correctly represents the \(\phi\) and XOR terms.

Because the model expression is structurally different and lacks explicit representation of the key functional terms, and because \(\mathcal{D}\) is undefined, it is not possible to confirm full equivalence.

At the same time, the model expression is clearly attempting to represent the same summation with the same variables and probability distributions, just in a more expanded and factored form.

Given this, the model expression is very close but incomplete or at least not fully explicit in the key functional part.

Therefore, I assign partial credit.

\subsection*{Problem 22 (Paper: 2506.21243v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a Riemannian 3-manifold with boundary, $M_{a,b,L}$, defined as the Cartesian product $A_{a,b} \times \RR/L\ZZ$, where $A_{a,b} = \{(x,y) \in \RR^2 : a^2 \leq x^2+y^2 \leq b^2\}$ for $0 < a < b$, and $L > 0$. The manifold is endowed with the flat metric $g = dx^2 + dy^2 + ds^2$, where $(x,y) \in A_{a,b}$ and $s \in \RR/L\ZZ$ are Cartesian coordinates. We also consider two Killing vector fields: $T = \partial_s$ and $P = -y\partial_x + x\partial_y$.

Let $\cX(M_{a,b,L},\CC)$ denote the space of smooth complex-valued vector fields on $M_{a,b,L}$. We are interested in the space of complex-valued curl eigenfields $E_{\CC,\lambda,\ell,m}(M_{a,b,L})$, defined as the set of vector fields $B \in \cX(M_{a,b,L},\CC)$ that satisfy the following conditions for given real numbers $\lambda \neq 0$, $\ell \in (2\pi/L)\ZZ$, and $m \in \ZZ$:
1.  $\curl B = \lambda B$
2.  $B \cdot n = 0$ on $\partial M_{a,b,L}$, where $n$ is the outward unit normal.
3.  $\cL_T B = i\ell B$
4.  $\cL_P B = im B$

For a non-trivial $B \in E_{\CC,\lambda,\ell,m}(M_{a,b,L})$, it must be that $\lambda^2 > \ell^2$. Let $\mu \coloneqq \sqrt{\lambda^2-\ell^2}$.
A vector field $B \in E_{\CC,\lambda,\ell,m}(M_{a,b,L})$ exists if and only if there exists a non-trivial scalar function $h \in C^{\infty}(M_{a,b,L},\CC)$ such that:
1.  $B = \lambda^2 h T + \lambda \nabla h \times T + i\ell \nabla h$.
2.  $h$ satisfies the partial differential equations: $\Delta h = -\lambda^2 h$, $\cL_T h = i\ell h$, and $\cL_P h = im h$.
3.  $h$ satisfies the following boundary conditions on $\partial M_{a,b,L}$:
    *   $-\frac{\lambda m}{a} h  + \ell \frac{\partial h}{\partial n} = 0$ on $\partial_1 M = \{(x,y) \in \RR^2 : x^2+y^2 = a^2\} \times \RR/L\ZZ$.
    *   $\frac{\lambda m}{b} h + \ell \frac{\partial h}{\partial n} = 0$ on $\partial_2 M = \{(x,y) \in \RR^2 : x^2+y^2 = b^2\} \times \RR/L\ZZ$.

In cylindrical coordinates $(r,\theta,s)$, a function $h$ satisfying the partial differential equations can be expressed as $h = (A J_m(\mu r) + BY_m(\mu r))e^{im\theta}e^{i \ell s}$ for some constants $A, B \in \mathbb{C}$, where $J_m$ and $Y_m$ are Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively, of order $m$.
Recall the Bessel function recurrence relations for $Z_m \in \{J_m,Y_m\}$:
$Z_m'(x) = \frac{Z_{m-1}(x) - Z_{m+1}(x)}{2}$
$\frac{m Z_m(x)}{x} = \frac{Z_{m-1}(x) + Z_{m+1}(x)}{2}$

\subsection*{Problem 23 (Paper: 2506.21290v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
The paper investigates the glass transition of molecular fluids using a novel Monte Carlo algorithm. To quantify the efficiency of their algorithm, the authors analyze the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time, $\tau_\alpha$. For the physical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ is found to follow an empirical parabolic law in Arrhenius coordinates:
$$ \ln \left( \frac{\tau_\alpha}{\tau_o} \right) = J^2 \left( \frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_p} \right)^2 $$
where $T$ is the temperature, $\tau_o$ is a characteristic onset timescale, $J$ is an energy parameter, and $T_p$ is an alternative onset temperature. The experimental glass transition temperature, $T_g$, is conventionally defined as the temperature at which the relaxation time reaches a value $10^{12}$ times its onset timescale, i.e., $\tau_\alpha(T_g)/\tau_o = 10^{12}$.

Task:
Derive the analytical expression for the experimental glass transition temperature $T_g$ in terms of $J$ and $T_p$.

Let's analyze the two expressions:

**Ground Truth:**
\[
T_g = \left( \frac{1}{T_p} + \frac{\sqrt{12 \ln(10)}}{J} \right)^{-1}
\]

**Model-Generated:**
\[
T_g = \frac{T_p}{1 + \left(\frac{T_p}{J}\right) \sqrt{12 \ln 10}}
\]

---

**Step 1: Check equivalence**

Rewrite the ground truth expression:

\[
T_g = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{T_p} + \frac{\sqrt{12 \ln(10)}}{J}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{T_p} + \frac{\sqrt{12 \ln(10)}}{J}}
\]

Find a common denominator inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{1}{T_p} + \frac{\sqrt{12 \ln(10)}}{J} = \frac{J + T_p \sqrt{12 \ln(10)}}{T_p J}
\]

Therefore,

\[
T_g = \frac{1}{\frac{J + T_p \sqrt{12 \ln(10)}}{T_p J}} = \frac{T_p J}{J + T_p \sqrt{12 \ln(10)}}
\]

---

**Step 2: Compare with model expression**

Model expression is:

\[
T_g = \frac{T_p}{1 + \frac{T_p}{J} \sqrt{12 \ln 10}} = \frac{T_p}{1 + \frac{T_p \sqrt{12 \ln 10}}{J}} = \frac{T_p}{\frac{J + T_p \sqrt{12 \ln 10}}{J}} = \frac{T_p J}{J + T_p \sqrt{12 \ln 10}}
\]

This matches exactly the simplified form of the ground truth.

**Conclusion:**

The model-generated expression is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expression, just written in a different but equivalent form.

\subsection*{Problem 24 (Paper: 2506.21290v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
In supercooled liquids, the structural relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ is intimately linked to the growth of dynamically correlated regions. The characteristic volume of these regions can be quantified by the peak value of the normalized four-point susceptibility, denoted as $(\chi_4/\chi_{\text{self}})^*$. Let $X = (\chi_4/\chi_{\text{self}})^*$. It has been empirically established that the relationship between $\tau_\alpha$ and $X$ can be described by a functional form that combines a power-law prefactor and an exponential term. The power-law prefactor is characterized by an integer exponent, and the argument of the exponential term is also characterized by an integer exponent, which is the same as the power-law prefactor's exponent. Furthermore, it is known that for this type of relationship, the relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ scales quadratically with $X$ in its power-law prefactor. The exponential term's argument is also found to scale quadratically with a scaled $X$. The general form of this relationship is $\tau_{\alpha} = A X^{\gamma} \exp\left\{ \left[ B X \right]^{\psi} \right\}$, where $A$, $B$, $\gamma$, and $\psi$ are empirical parameters.

Task:
Determine the complete empirical functional form that describes the relationship between the structural relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ and the normalized peak four-point susceptibility $X = (\chi_4/\chi_{\text{self}})^*$, including the specific values of the empirical parameters $A$, $B$, $\gamma$, and $\psi$.

The model-generated expression is:
\[
\tau_\alpha = X^{2}\,\exp\!\left( X^{2} \right)

where presumably \(X\) is meant to represent \(\left(\frac{\chi_4}{\chi_{\text{self}}}\right)^*\) or some related quantity.

**Comparison:**

- The model expression omits the prefactor \(0.10\).
- The argument inside the exponential in the ground truth is \(\left[1.22 \times 10^{-3} \left(\frac{\chi_4}{\chi_{\text{self}}}\right)^*\right]^2\), which is \((1.22 \times 10^{-3})^2 \times \left(\frac{\chi_4}{\chi_{\text{self}}}\right)^{*2}\).
- The model expression uses simply \(X^2\) inside the exponential, missing the factor \(1.22 \times 10^{-3}\).
- The model expression also uses an equals sign instead of \(\simeq\), but this is minor.
- The model expression is missing the scaling factor outside the exponential.

Because the model expression misses the numerical prefactor outside the exponential and the small coefficient inside the exponential, it is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expression.

This is more than one minor error: missing the prefactor and missing the coefficient inside the exponential.

\subsection*{Problem 25 (Paper: 2506.21318v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a quantum system of $N_S$ qubits coupled to a bath of $N_B$ auxiliary qubits. The bath qubits are initially prepared in the product state $\hat\Phi = \ket{0}\bra{0}^{\otimes N_B}$. The system's density matrix $\hat\rho$ evolves under a repeated quantum channel, referred to as a "reset cycle," defined as $\mathcal{E}(\hat\rho) = \text{tr}_B [\mathcal{Q}(\hat\rho\otimes\hat\Phi)\mathcal{Q}^\dagger]$.

For this derivation, consider the unrandomized protocol, where the joint unitary $\mathcal{Q}$ is decomposed into $2M_T+1$ unitary layers: $\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{U}_{M_T}\ldots \mathcal{U}_{0}\ldots \mathcal{U}_{-M_T}$. Each layer $\mathcal{U}_\tau$ is given by $\mathcal{U_\tau} = e^{-i\delta\theta \hat V_{\tau}}e^{-i\delta\hat H_B}e^{-i\delta \hat H_S}$, where $\theta$ is a small system-bath coupling parameter and $\delta$ is a small Trotter angle. $\hat H_S$ is the system Hamiltonian. The bath Hamiltonian is $\hat H_B = -\frac{h}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^{N_B} \hat Z_\mu$, where $h$ is a single bath energy scale and $\hat Z_\mu$ is the Pauli-$Z$ matrix on the $\mu$-th auxiliary qubit. The $\tau$-dependent coupling operator is $\hat V_{\tau} = f_\tau\sum_{\mu = 1}^{N_B} \hat A_\mu \hat Y_\mu$, where $f_\tau$ is a real-valued modulating function, $\hat A_\mu$ are Hermitian system operators, and $\hat Y_\mu$ is the Pauli-$Y$ matrix on the $\mu$-th auxiliary qubit.

The interaction picture is defined with respect to the free system-bath evolution as $\tilde{O}_\tau = U_0^{-\tau} (\hat O_\tau)U_0^\tau$, where $U_0 = e^{-i\delta\hat H_B}e^{-i\delta \hat H_S}$. In this picture, the interaction-picture map is $\tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\hat \rho) = \text{tr}_B\big[ \tilde{\mathcal{Q}}(\hat\rho\otimes \hat\Phi)\tilde{Q}^{\dagger}\big]$. The bath correlation function is given by $\text{tr}_B( \tilde Y_{\mu,\tau}\tilde Y_{\mu',\tau'} \hat\Phi) = \delta_{\mu,\mu'}e^{ih\delta(\tau'-\tau)}$.

Task:
Derive the interaction-picture map $\tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\hat \rho)$ to second order in the system-bath coupling parameter $\theta$. Express the result in the Lindblad form:
$\frac{\tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\hat\rho)-\hat{\rho}}{\theta^2} = -i[\hat G^{\text{LS}}, \hat\rho]+ \{\hat K,\hat\rho\}+\sum_\mu \hat L_\mu \hat\rho\hat L_\mu^\dagger$.
Specifically, derive the expressions for the jump operator $\hat L_\mu$, the Hermitian operator $\hat K$, and the Lamb-shift Hamiltonian $\hat G^{\text{LS}}$ in terms of the given parameters and operators.

\subsection*{Problem 26 (Paper: 2506.21318v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a quantum system with Hamiltonian $\hat H_S$, whose eigenstates are $\ket{\phi_a}$ with corresponding eigenvalues $\epsilon_a$. The transition frequencies are denoted by $\omega_{ab} = \epsilon_b - \epsilon_a$, and the average energies by $\bar{\epsilon}_{ab} = (\epsilon_a + \epsilon_b)/2$. The target thermal state is the Gibbs state, $\hat\sigma_\beta = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$, where $Z = \text{tr}(e^{-\beta \hat H_S})$ is the partition function and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature.

The system evolves under a quantum channel $\mathcal{E}(\hat\rho)$, which describes a reset cycle involving joint unitary evolution and bath qubit reset. At late times, the system converges to a fixed point $\hat\sigma$ of this channel. Under a weak system-bath coupling assumption, characterized by a small parameter $\theta$, the steady state $\hat\sigma$ can be expanded as $\hat\sigma = \hat\sigma_0 + \theta^2 \hat\zeta$, where $\hat\sigma_0 = \hat\sigma_\beta$ represents the zeroth-order solution for the diagonal elements in the Hamiltonian eigenbasis.

The interaction-picture map $\tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\hat\rho)$ is related to the Schrödinger-picture map $\mathcal{E}(\hat\rho)$ by $\mathcal{E}(\hat\rho) = \mathcal{S}^{M_T+M_R} \circ\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\circ\mathcal{S}^{M_T+1}(\hat\rho)$, where $\mathcal{S}(\hat\rho) = e^{-i\delta \hat H_S}(\hat\rho)e^{i\delta \hat H_S}$ is the system unitary evolution channel, $\delta$ is a small Trotter angle, and $M_T$ is the number of unitary layers. An optional randomization step involves a random integer $M_R$, leading to an averaged dephasing channel $\mathcal{D}(\hat\rho) = \frac{1}{T_0} \int_0^\infty dT_R\ e^{-T_R/T0} e^{-i\hat H_ST_R} (\hat\rho) e^{i\hat H_ST_R} = \sum_{ab} \frac{\ket{\phi_a}\bra{\phi_a}\hat\rho\ket{\phi_b}\bra{\phi_b} }{1-i\omega_{ab}T_0}$, where $T_0$ is a characteristic randomization time. The total reset time is $T = M_T\delta$.

The interaction-picture map $\tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\hat\rho)$ can be expanded to second order in $\theta$ and expressed in a Lindblad-like form:
$\frac{\tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\hat\rho)-\hat{\rho}}{\theta^2} = -i[\hat G^{\text{LS}}, \hat\rho]+ \{\hat K,\hat\rho\}+\sum_\mu \hat L_\mu \hat\rho\hat L_\mu^\dagger$.
Here, $\hat L_\mu = \int_{-\infty}^\infty dt\ g(t) \tilde A_\mu(t)$ are the jump operators, where $g(t) = e^{iht} f_{t/\delta}$ and $f_\tau = \exp(-\frac{a^2\delta^2\tau^2}{2})$ is the filter function with $a = \sqrt{\frac{4 h}{\beta}}$ and $h$ being the bath energy scale. $\tilde A_\mu(t) = e^{i\hat H_S t}\hat A_\mu e^{-i\hat H_S t}$ are interaction-picture system operators, with $\hat A_\mu$ being local system operators. The operator $\hat K = \frac{1}{2}\sum_\mu \hat L^\dagger_\mu\hat L_\mu$. The Lamb shift Hamiltonian is $\hat G^{\text{LS}} = \frac{1}{2i}\sum_\mu \iint_{-\infty}^\infty dtdt'\ \text{sgn}(t-t')g^*(t)g(t') \tilde A^\dagger_{\mu}(t)\tilde A_{\mu}(t')$.

For the Gibbs state to be an exact fixed point, the Lindbladian must satisfy quantum detailed balance (QDB), which requires an ideal Lamb shift $\hat G^{\text{DB}}$ such that $\hat G^{\text{DB}}_{ab} = -i\tanh \bigg(\frac{\beta\omega_{ab}}{4}\bigg)\hat K_{ab}$. The actual protocol's Lamb shift $\hat G^{\text{LS}}$ differs from this ideal form, leading to a deviation $\Delta \hat G = \hat G^{\text{LS}}-\hat G^{\text{DB}}$.

The leading-order correction to the coherences of the steady state, $\hat\zeta_{ab}$ (for $a \neq b$), is given by:
$\hat\zeta_{ab} = -\frac{e^{-\beta\bar{\epsilon}_{ab}} }{Z}\frac{2i\sinh(\beta\omega_{ab}/2)e^{iT\omega_{ab}}} {[1 - e^{2iT\omega_{ab}}-i\omega_{ab}T_0]}(\Delta \hat G)_{ab}$.

The steady state $\hat\sigma$ can also be viewed as approximately proportional to a Gibbs state defined with respect to a renormalized system Hamiltonian $\hat H'_S = \hat H_S+\theta^2\hat C$, where $\hat C$ is a matrix representing the leading-order correction to $\hat H_S$ due to the bath interaction. The expansion of $e^{-\beta(\hat H_S+\theta^2\hat C)}$ using the Kubo formula is $e^{-\beta(\hat H_S+\theta^2\hat C)} = e^{-\beta \hat H_S}\bigg(1-\theta^2 \int_0^\beta d\beta'  \hat C(\beta') +\mathcal{O}(\theta^4)\bigg)$, where $\hat C(\beta') = e^{\beta' \hat H_S}\hat C e^{-\beta' \hat H_S}$.

Task:
Derive the matrix elements $\hat C_{ab}$ of the leading-order correction $\hat C$ to the system Hamiltonian $\hat H_S$, in the eigenbasis of $\hat H_S$, by equating the second-order steady-state coherence correction $\hat\zeta_{ab}$ with the corresponding term from the Kubo formula expansion of the renormalized Gibbs state $\hat\sigma \propto e^{-\beta \hat H'_S}$. Note that the diagonal part $\Lambda_a$ remains undetermined in this second-order scheme.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{\hat C_{ab} = -\frac{i\omega_{ab}e^{i\omega_{ab}T}}{1-i\omega_{ab}T_0-e^{2i\omega_{ab}T}} (\Delta \hat G)_{ab} +\delta_{ab}\Lambda_a} \]

\end{cases}
\;

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is a single formula for \(\hat{C}_{ab}\) that includes both the diagonal and off-diagonal terms in one expression:

\[
\hat C_{ab} = -\frac{i\omega_{ab}e^{i\omega_{ab}T}}{1 - i\omega_{ab}T_0 - e^{2i\omega_{ab}T}} (\Delta \hat G)_{ab} + \delta_{ab} \Lambda_a
\]

The model-generated expression splits the diagonal and off-diagonal terms explicitly:

\[
C_{ab} = \begin{cases}
\Lambda_a, & a=b, \\
\dfrac{i \omega_{ab} e^{i T \omega_{ab}}}{1 - e^{2i T \omega_{ab}} - i \omega_{ab} T_0} (\Delta G)_{ab}, & a \neq b,
\end{cases}
\]

Let's analyze the differences:

1. **Sign difference:**  
   The ground truth has a negative sign in front of the fraction for the off-diagonal terms, while the model expression has a positive sign.

2. **Order of terms in denominator:**  
   Ground truth denominator: \(1 - i \omega_{ab} T_0 - e^{2i \omega_{ab} T}\)  
   Model denominator: \(1 - e^{2i T \omega_{ab}} - i \omega_{ab} T_0\)  
   The order of the last two terms is swapped, but addition is commutative, so this is equivalent.

3. **Variable notation:**  
   The ground truth uses \(\hat{C}_{ab}\) and \((\Delta \hat{G})_{ab}\), while the model uses \(C_{ab}\) and \((\Delta G)_{ab}\). This is acceptable as variable names can differ.

4. **Diagonal terms:**  
   Ground truth uses \(\delta_{ab} \Lambda_a\), which is equivalent to the model's piecewise definition \(\Lambda_a\) when \(a=b\).

5. **Exponent order:**  
   Both have \(e^{i \omega_{ab} T}\) in the numerator, just written as \(e^{i T \omega_{ab}}\) in the model, which is equivalent.

**Summary:**  
The only substantive difference is the missing negative sign in the off-diagonal term in the model expression. This is a significant error because it changes the sign of the entire off-diagonal term.

Since there is one major sign error (not a minor missing coefficient or constant), the model expression is not completely correct. However, it is very close to the ground truth, with only one sign error.

According to the rubric, one wrong sign is a minor error and warrants partial credit.

\subsection*{Problem 27 (Paper: 2506.21400v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a two-dimensional Hermitian Hamiltonian $h_0$ given by $h_0 = p_x^2 - p_y^2 + \nu^2 x^2 + \Omega y^2 + g x y$, where $x, y$ are position operators, $p_x, p_y$ are momentum operators, and $\nu, \Omega, g$ are real parameters. The ground state wavefunction of $h_0$ is $\phi_0(x,y) = C_0 e^{-\frac{\alpha x^2}{2}-\frac{\beta y^2}{2} +\gamma x y}$, where $C_0$ is a normalization constant and $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are real parameters.

We introduce a non-unitary similarity transformation using two operators, $\eta_0$ and $\eta_1$.
The first operator is $\eta_0 = \exp\left( -\frac{\delta}{2} x^2 -\frac{\lambda}{2} y^2 \right)$, where $\delta, \lambda$ are real parameters. Its adjoint actions on the momentum operators are $\eta_0 p_x \eta_0^{-1} = p_x - i \delta x$ and $\eta_0 p_y \eta_0^{-1} = p_y - i \lambda y$. The position operators transform as $\eta_0 x \eta_0^{-1} = x$ and $\eta_0 y \eta_0^{-1} = y$.
The Hamiltonian $h_0$ is transformed into a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian $H_1 = \eta_0 h_0 \eta_0^{-1}$. The corresponding ground state wavefunction is $\psi_1(x,y) = \eta_0(x,y) \phi_0(x,y)$.

The second operator is $\eta_1 = \exp\left( \frac{\kappa}{2} p_x^2 +\frac{\xi}{2} p_y^2 \right)$, where $\kappa, \xi$ are real parameters. Its adjoint actions on the position operators are $\eta_1 x \eta_1^{-1} = x - i \kappa p_x$ and $\eta_1 y \eta_1^{-1} = y - i \xi p_y$. The momentum operators transform as $\eta_1 p_x \eta_1^{-1} = p_x$ and $\eta_1 p_y \eta_1^{-1} = p_y$.
The Hamiltonian $H_1$ is further transformed into $H_2 = \eta_1 H_1 \eta_1^{-1}$. For this transformation, the parameters $\kappa$ and $\xi$ are chosen as $\kappa = \frac{\delta}{\delta^2 - \nu^2}$ and $\xi = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda^2 + \Omega}$.
The ground state wavefunction $\psi_2(x,y)$ corresponding to $H_2$ is obtained by applying $\eta_1$ to $\psi_1(x,y)$ in momentum space: $\psi_2(x,y) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}_{xy} \left[ \eta_1(p_x,p_y) \hat{\psi}_1(p_x,p_y) \right] (x,y)$, where $\hat{\psi}_1(p_x,p_y)$ is the Fourier transform of $\psi_1(x,y)$.
The Fourier transform of a 2D Gaussian function $f(\mathbf{x}) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{x}^T M \mathbf{x}}$ is $\hat{f}(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}}{\sqrt{\det M}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^T M^{-1} \mathbf{p}}$.
The inverse Fourier transform of a 2D Gaussian function $\hat{f}(\mathbf{p}) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^T M_p \mathbf{p}}$ is $f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}}{\sqrt{\det M_p}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{x}^T M_p^{-1} \mathbf{x}}$.
The wavefunction $\psi_2(x,y)$ takes the form $C_2 e^{-\frac{\hat{\alpha} x^2}{2}-\frac{\hat{\beta} y^2}{2} +\hat{\gamma} x y}$, where $C_2$ is a normalization constant. You may ignore normalization constants $C_0, C_1, C_2$ in your derivation of the exponent parameters.

Task:
Determine the expression for the parameter $\hat{\alpha}$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{\hat{\alpha} = \frac{ \left[(\alpha +\delta ) (\beta  \lambda -\Omega )-\gamma ^2 \lambda \right] \left(\delta ^2-\nu ^2\right) }{\left(\alpha  \delta +\nu ^2\right) (\Omega -\beta  \lambda )+\gamma ^2 \delta  \lambda }} \]

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is a single rational expression with a clear numerator and denominator:

\[
\hat{\alpha} = \frac{ \left[(\alpha +\delta ) (\beta  \lambda -\Omega )-\gamma ^2 \lambda \right] \left(\delta ^2-\nu ^2\right) }{\left(\alpha  \delta +\nu ^2\right) (\Omega -\beta  \lambda )+\gamma ^2 \delta  \lambda }
\]

The model-generated expression is a complicated nested fraction involving sums and differences of fractions, with denominators like \((\alpha+\delta)(\beta+\lambda)-\gamma^2\) and \(\lambda^2 + \Omega\), and terms like \(\frac{\alpha+\delta}{(\alpha+\delta)(\beta+\lambda)-\gamma^2}\), etc.

Key observations:

- The ground truth has terms \(\beta \lambda - \Omega\) and \(\Omega - \beta \lambda\), but the model uses \(\beta + \lambda\) and \(\lambda^2 + \Omega\), which are different.
- The ground truth denominator is \(\left(\alpha \delta + \nu^2\right)(\Omega - \beta \lambda) + \gamma^2 \delta \lambda\), but the model denominator is a complicated expression involving sums and products of fractions, none of which match the ground truth denominator.
- The model expression is structurally very different and does not simplify obviously to the ground truth.
- The model expression contains multiple nested fractions and terms that do not appear in the ground truth.
- The model expression has \(\beta + \lambda\) where the ground truth has \(\beta \lambda\), which is a significant difference.
- The model expression has \(\lambda^2 + \Omega\) where the ground truth has \(\Omega - \beta \lambda\), again a significant difference.

Given these differences, the model expression is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth. The differences are more than minor errors; they involve different operations (addition vs multiplication), different signs, and different terms.

Therefore, the model expression is incorrect.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
In quantum mechanics, canonical variables $x, y, p_x, p_y$ satisfy the commutation relations $[x, p_x] = i$, $[y, p_y] = i$, and all other commutators are zero. Consider a non-unitary similarity transformation operator $\eta_2$ defined as $\eta_2 = \exp\left( \mu p_x p_y + \tau x y \right)$, where $\mu, \tau \in \mathbb{R}$. The parameter $\theta$ is defined as $\theta := \sqrt{\mu \tau}$. The adjoint action of an operator $A$ on another operator $B$ is given by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula:
$$e^A B e^{-A} = B + [A, B] + \frac{1}{2!}[A, [A, B]] + \frac{1}{3!}[A, [A, [A, B]]] + \cdots$$

Task:
Derive the expression for the adjoint action of $\eta_2$ on the position operator $x$.

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is:
\[
\eta_2 x \eta_2^{-1} = \cosh(\theta) x - i \frac{\mu}{\theta} \sinh(\theta) p_y
\]

The model-generated expression is:
\[
\eta_2 x \eta_2^{-1} = x \cosh(\sqrt{\mu \tau}) - i \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{\mu \tau}} \sinh(\sqrt{\mu \tau}) p_y
\]

Comparison:
- The ground truth uses the parameter \(\theta\).
- The model uses \(\sqrt{\mu \tau}\) in place of \(\theta\).
- The structure of the expression is the same: a hyperbolic cosine term multiplying \(x\), and a hyperbolic sine term multiplied by \(-i \frac{\mu}{\theta} p_y\).
- The model has the same form but replaces \(\theta\) with \(\sqrt{\mu \tau}\).

Since the problem states that differences in variable names are acceptable if the expressions are mathematically equivalent, the key question is whether \(\theta = \sqrt{\mu \tau}\) or not.

If \(\theta\) is defined as \(\sqrt{\mu \tau}\), then the expressions are equivalent. However, the ground truth expression explicitly uses \(\theta\), and the model introduces \(\sqrt{\mu \tau}\) without explanation.

Because the model replaces \(\theta\) with \(\sqrt{\mu \tau}\) without clarification, this could be a variable substitution or a redefinition. If \(\theta\) is defined as \(\sqrt{\mu \tau}\), then the expressions are equivalent.

Given the rubric allows differences in variable names, and the model's expression matches the ground truth in form and coefficients, the model's expression is mathematically equivalent assuming \(\theta = \sqrt{\mu \tau}\).

Therefore, the model's expression is completely correct.

The dynamics of a magnetized plasma can be described by an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system on the space $\mathfrak{s}^*$ of triples $(n,\bm{P},\varrho)$, where $n(\bm{q})$ is the electron density, $\bm{P}(\bm{q})$ is the electron momentum density, and $\varrho(\bm{q},\bm{\xi})$ is the centered electron velocity distribution. The spatial domain $\bm{q} = (x,y)$ is a $2$-torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ with period $2\pi$ in each direction, and the velocity domain $\bm{\xi} = (\xi_x,\xi_y)$ is $\mathbb{R}^2$. The system is characterized by a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ and a magnetic field $B(\bm{q})$.

The following definitions and operators are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbb{J} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1\\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$.
    \item The Laplace operator $\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2$.

\end{align*}
The quasineutral limit of this system corresponds to dynamics on a specific submanifold $\Sigma\subset\mathfrak{s}^*$, defined by the conditions $\partial_{\bm{q}}n = 0$ and $\partial_{\bm{q}}\cdot\bm{P} = 0$. This implies that on $\Sigma$, $n$ is a constant, denoted $n_0$, and $\bm{P}$ is a divergence-free vector field, denoted $\bm{\pi}$. Thus, elements of $\Sigma$ are of the form $(n_0,\bm{\pi},\varrho)$.

For a point $\sigma=(n_0,\bm{\pi},\varrho)\in\Sigma$, the tangent space $T_\sigma\Sigma$ is given by $T_\sigma\Sigma = \{(\delta n_0,\delta\bm{\pi},\delta\varrho)\mid \delta n_0\in \mathbb{R},\quad \delta\bm{\pi}:\mathbb{T}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2,\quad \delta\varrho:\mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}, \quad \partial_{\bm{q}}\cdot\delta\bm{\pi} = 0\}$.
The annihilator of $T_\sigma\Sigma$ in the dual tangent space $T^*_\sigma\mathfrak{s}^*$ is $T_\sigma\Sigma^\circ = \{(\delta n^*,\delta\bm{P}^*,\delta\varrho^*)\in T^*_\sigma\mathfrak{s}^*\mid \exists\delta\Phi^*:\mathbb{T}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R},\quad\int\delta\Phi^*\,d\bm{q} = 0,\quad \int \delta n^*\,d\bm{q} = 0,\quad \delta\bm{P}^* =\partial_{\bm{q}}\delta\Phi^*,\quad \delta\varrho^* = 0\}$.

The submanifold $\Sigma$ is a Poisson-Dirac submanifold, meaning it inherits a Poisson bracket $\{\cdot,\cdot\}_\Sigma$ from the ambient space $\mathfrak{s}^*$. For functionals $F,G:\Sigma\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, the induced bracket $\{F,G\}_\Sigma(\sigma)$ is computed using the Poisson tensor $\pi_E$ associated with $\{\cdot,\cdot\}_E$ and specific covector extensions $\widetilde{(dF_\sigma)}, \widetilde{(dG_\sigma)}\in T^*_\sigma\mathfrak{s}^*$. These extensions must satisfy two conditions:
1.  They must agree with the differentials of $F$ and $G$ on $T_\sigma\Sigma$. For example, $\widetilde{(dG_\sigma)}\mid T_\sigma\Sigma = dG_\sigma$.
2.  They must annihilate the image of $T_\sigma\Sigma^\circ$ under the Poisson tensor, i.e., $\widetilde{(dG_\sigma)}\mid \widehat{\pi}_E(T_\sigma\Sigma^\circ) = 0$. The map $\widehat{\pi}_E: T^*_\sigma\mathfrak{s}^* \rightarrow T_\sigma\mathfrak{s}^*$ is defined by the general Hamilton's equations, where $\partial_t n, \partial_t \bm{P}, \partial_t (n\varrho)$ represent the components of $\widehat{\pi}_E$ when the functional derivatives $\frac{\delta G}{\delta n}, \frac{\delta G}{\delta \bm{P}}, \frac{\delta G}{\delta \varrho}$ are replaced by the covector components $\delta n^*, \delta \bm{P}^*, \delta \varrho^*$.

For a functional $G:\Sigma\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, its differential $dG_\sigma$ on $T_\sigma\Sigma$ is given by $dG_\sigma(\delta n_0,\delta\bm{\pi},\delta\varrho) = \int \frac{\delta G}{\delta n_0}\,\delta n_0\,d\bm{q} + \int \frac{\delta G}{\delta \bm{\pi}}\cdot\delta\bm{\pi}\,d\bm{q} + \int\frac{\delta G}{\delta\varrho}\,\delta\varrho\,d\bm{\xi}\,d\bm{q}$.
The covector extension $\widetilde{(dG_\sigma)}$ can be written as $\int \widetilde{\frac{\delta G}{\delta n_0}}\,\delta n\,d\bm{q} + \int \widetilde{\frac{\delta G}{\delta\bm{\pi}}}\cdot \delta\bm{P}\,d\bm{q} + \int \widetilde{\frac{\delta G}{\delta\varrho}}\,\delta\varrho\,d\bm{\xi}\,d\bm{q}$.
The conditions for $\widetilde{(dG_\sigma)}$ imply that the effective functional derivatives to be used in the ambient bracket $\{\cdot,\cdot\}_E$ (where $n$ is replaced by $n_0$ and $\bm{P}$ by $\bm{\pi}$) are:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\delta G}{\delta n}&\rightarrow \frac{\delta G}{\delta n_0} -\frac{\bm{\pi}}{n_0}\cdot\frac{\delta G}{\delta\bm{\pi}} + \Delta^{-1}\bigg(\partial_{\bm{q}}\cdot\bigg[\frac{1}{\epsilon}(B-\epsilon\,\Omega)\mathbb{J}\frac{\delta G}{\delta\bm{\pi}} - \partial_{\bm{q}}\cdot\left(\left\langle\partial_{\bm{\xi}}\left(\frac{1}{n_0}\frac{\delta G}{\delta\varrho}\right)\bm{\xi}\right\rangle\right) + \partial_{\bm{q}}\left\langle\frac{1}{n_0}\frac{\delta G}{\delta \varrho}\right\rangle - \left\langle\partial_{\bm{q}}\frac{1}{n_0}\frac{\delta G}{\delta\varrho}\right\rangle\bigg]\bigg)\\
\frac{\delta G}{\delta\bm{P}}&\rightarrow \frac{\delta G}{\delta\bm{\pi}}\\
\frac{\delta G}{\delta\varrho} & \rightarrow\frac{\delta G}{\delta\varrho}
\end{align*}
Similar substitutions apply for the functional derivatives of $F$.

Task:
Using the provided Poisson bracket $\{\cdot,\cdot\}_E$ and the effective functional derivative substitutions for $F$ and $G$, derive the explicit formula for the induced Poisson bracket $\{\cdot,\cdot\}_\Sigma$ on the submanifold $\Sigma$.

\subsection*{Problem 30 (Paper: 2506.21424v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
In the Nonideal Statistical Field Theory (NISFT), the critical properties of nonideal systems undergoing continuous phase transitions are described by critical exponents. These systems, unlike ideal ones, exhibit defects, inhomogeneities, and impurities, which are accounted for by a nonideal parameter $a$ (where $0 < a < 2$). The theory generalizes the description of ideal systems, which are recovered in the limit $a \rightarrow 1$. Two fundamental nonideal critical exponents, $\eta_a$ and $\nu_a$, are given up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in an $\epsilon$-expansion, where $\epsilon = 4 - d$ and $d$ is the spatial dimension. For a system with $N$ components, these exponents are:
$$ \eta_{a} = \dfrac{(N + 2)}{2a(N + 8)^{2}}\epsilon^{2} + \dfrac{(N + 2)}{8a(N + 8)^{4}}(-N^{2} + 56N + 272)\epsilon^{3} $$
$$ \nu_{a} = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{(N + 2)}{4a(N + 8)}\epsilon + \dfrac{(N + 2)}{8a^{2}(N + 8)^{3}}[N^{2} + (19a + 4)N + 92a - 32]\epsilon^{2} $$
The critical exponent $\gamma_a$, which describes the susceptibility scaling behavior, is related to $\eta_a$ and $\nu_a$ through the nonideal scaling relation:
$$ \gamma_{a} = \nu_{a}(2 - \eta_{a}) $$

Task:
Using the provided expressions for $\eta_a$ and $\nu_a$, and the given scaling relation, determine the analytical expression for the critical exponent $\gamma_a$ up to next-to-leading order, i.e., up to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$.

The model-generated expression matches the ground truth exactly in all terms up to order \(\epsilon^2\). The coefficients, powers, and variables are all consistent. The only difference is that the model includes an additional \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{3})\) term, which is a standard notation indicating higher-order terms and does not affect the correctness of the expression up to \(\epsilon^2\).

Since the model expression is mathematically equivalent and includes the same terms as the ground truth, it is completely correct.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
In the Nonideal Statistical Field Theory (NISFT), the critical properties of systems undergoing continuous phase transitions are described, accounting for defects, inhomogeneities, and impurities. This theory generalizes the standard O($N$)-symmetric $\lambda\phi^4$ theory by introducing a nonideal distribution parameter $a$, where $0 < a < 2$. When $a \rightarrow 1$, the theory reduces to the ideal case. The system's order parameter has $N$ components. Critical exponents, which characterize the behavior of physical quantities near the critical point, are calculated using renormalization group and $\epsilon$-expansion techniques. The spatial dimension is $d$, and the expansion parameter is defined as $\epsilon = 4 - d$. One such critical exponent is $\delta_a$, which describes the behavior of the order parameter at the critical point.

Task:
Determine the analytical expression for the critical exponent $\delta_a$ up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the $\epsilon$-expansion, as derived within the Nonideal Statistical Field Theory framework.

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression for \(\delta_a\) is a detailed expansion up to order \(\epsilon^3\), with explicit coefficients involving \(a\), \(N\), and powers of \((N+8)\). It includes terms up to \(\epsilon^3\) with complicated polynomial coefficients.

The model-generated expression only includes terms up to order \(\epsilon^2\), and the coefficient of \(\epsilon^2\) is given as \(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{a(N+2)}{(N+8)^2}\), which is structurally different from the ground truth coefficient of \(\epsilon^2\), which is:

\[
\frac{1}{2a(N+8)^2} \left[ aN^2 + (16a - 2)N + 64a - 4 \right]
\]

The model's coefficient does not match this expression, and the model does not include the \(\epsilon^3\) term at all, instead replacing it with \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)\).

Therefore, the model's expression is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expression. It is missing the \(\epsilon^3\) term entirely and the \(\epsilon^2\) coefficient is different.

This is more than one minor error: the \(\epsilon^2\) coefficient is incorrect, and the \(\epsilon^3\) term is missing.

Hence, the score should be 0.

\subsection*{Problem 32 (Paper: 2506.21428v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a quantum system described by a time-dependent Hamiltonian $H(t) = H_0 + e^{\epsilon t}f(t)B$, where $H_0$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian, $B$ is an operator representing the perturbation, $f(t)$ is a time-dependent external field, and $\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+$ is a positive infinitesimal ensuring the perturbation vanishes in the distant past. The system's density matrix $\rho(t)$ evolves according to the Schr\"odinger equation. The $n$-th order contribution to the density matrix, $\rho_n(t)$, satisfies the equation of motion $\dot{\rho_n}(t) = -i[H_0, \rho_n(t)] - ie^{\epsilon t}f(t)[B, \rho_{n-1}(t)]$. The average of an observable $A$ at $n$-th order in perturbation theory, $\mathrm{tr}(A\rho_n(t))$, is defined in terms of the $n$-th order non-linear causal response function $\chi^{(n)}_{AB}(t-t_1, \dots, t-t_n)$ as:
$$ \mathrm{tr}(A\rho_n(t)) \equiv e^{n\epsilon t}\int\prod_{j=1}^n\mathrm{d}t_j f(t_j)e^{-\epsilon(t-t_j)}\chi^{(n)}_{AB}(t-t_1,\cdots,t-t_n) $$
The causal response function $\chi^{(n)}_{AB}$ vanishes if any of its arguments are negative. Its Fourier transform is denoted by $\chi^{(n)}_{AB}(\omega_1, \dots, \omega_n)$. When performing Fourier transforms, the notation $\omega_j^+ = \omega_j + i\epsilon$ is used. The response function is symmetric under the exchange of any pair of frequency arguments, i.e., $\chi^{(n)}_{AB}(\dots, \omega_j, \dots, \omega_k, \dots) = \chi^{(n)}_{AB}(\dots, \omega_k, \dots, \omega_j, \dots)$. Assume that the Fourier transform of $f(t)$ is $f(\omega) = \int dt e^{i\omega t} f(t)$.

Task:
Derive the recurrence relation that connects the $n$-th order causal response function $\chi^{(n)}_{AB}(\{\omega^+_j\}_{j=1}^n)$ to the $(n-1)$-th order causal response function.

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression relates the sum of frequencies multiplied by the nth-order susceptibility \(\chi^{(n)}_{AB}\) to a combination of a commutator susceptibility \(\chi^{(n)}_{[A,H_0]B}\) and a symmetrized term involving \(\chi^{(n-1)}_{[A,B]B}\) divided by \(n\). It is an equation expressing a relationship between these susceptibilities with frequency arguments and symmetrization over frequencies.

The model-generated expression, however, expresses \(\chi^{(n)}_{AB}\) directly as a fraction involving \(n\) divided by the sum of frequencies times \(\chi^{(n-1)}_{[A,B]B}\) with one fewer frequency argument. It does not include the \(\chi^{(n)}_{[A,H_0]B}\) term, nor the symmetrization indicated by \((\omega_1^+ \leftrightarrow \omega_{j \neq 1}^+)\). The structure and terms are quite different.

Specifically:
- The ground truth has a sum over frequencies multiplying \(\chi^{(n)}_{AB}\) on the left, while the model has \(\chi^{(n)}_{AB}\) isolated on the left.
- The ground truth includes a commutator susceptibility term \(\chi^{(n)}_{[A,H_0]B}\) which is missing in the model.
- The ground truth has a symmetrized term involving \(\chi^{(n-1)}_{[A,B]B}\) divided by \(n\), while the model has a factor of \(n\) in the numerator and no symmetrization.
- The frequency arguments differ in indexing and symmetrization.

These differences are more than minor errors; the model expression is missing a key term and the symmetrization, and the structure is different.

Therefore, the model expression is incorrect relative to the ground truth.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a quantum system described by a time-independent Hamiltonian $H_0$, which is perturbed by an external field. The total Hamiltonian is given by $H(t) = H_0 + e^{\epsilon t}f(t)B$, where $B$ is an operator, $f(t)$ is a time-dependent function, and $\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+$ ensures the perturbation vanishes in the distant past. The system is initially in thermal equilibrium, with the unperturbed density matrix $\rho_0 = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}\exp(-\beta H_0)$, where $\mathcal{Z}$ is the partition function and $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.

The $n$-th order causal response function, $\chi^{(n)}_{AB}(\{\omega_i\}_{i=1}^n)$, describes the system's response of an observable $A$ to the perturbation. In the eigenbasis of $H_0$, with eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$, the causal response function can be expressed in the Lehmann representation as:
$$ \chi^{(n)}_{AB}(\{\omega_i\}_{i=1}^n)=\frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}\sum_{i_1,\cdots,i_{n+1}}B^{i_1}_{i_2}\cdots B^{i_n}_{i_{n+1}}A^{i_{n+1}}_{i_1}f^{(n)}_{i_1,\cdots,i_{n+1}}(\{\omega_i\}_{i=1}^n) $$
where $A^k_l = \langle k|A|l\rangle$ and $B^k_l = \langle k|B|l\rangle$ are matrix elements, and $f^{(n)}_{i_1,\cdots,i_{n+1}}(\{\omega_i\}_{i=1}^n)$ is a function that captures the frequency dependence. The physical response function $\chi^{(n)}_{AB}$ is symmetric under the permutation of its frequency arguments $\{\omega_i\}_{i=1}^n$. This implies that $f^{(n)}_{i_1,\cdots,i_{n+1}}(\{\omega_i\}_{i=1}^n)$ must also be symmetrized over all $n!$ permutations of its frequency arguments.

The unsymmetrized function $f^{(n)}_{i_1,\cdots,i_{n+1}}(\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_n)$ satisfies the following recurrence relation:
$$ f^{(n)}_{i_1,\cdots,i_{n+1}}(\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_n)=\frac{1}{\omega^+_t+\epsilon_{i_{n+1}}-\epsilon_{i_1}}\Big(f^{(n-1)}_{i_2,\cdots,i_{n+1}}(\omega_2,\cdots,\omega_{n})-f^{(n-1)}_{i_1,\cdots,i_{n}}(\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_{n-1})\Big) $$
where $\omega_t^+ = \sum_{k=1}^n \omega_k^+$, $\omega_k^+ = \omega_k + i\epsilon$, and $\epsilon_{ij} = \epsilon_i - \epsilon_j$.
The base case for this recurrence relation, for $n=1$, is given by:
$$ f^{(1)}_{i_1,i_2}(\omega)=\frac{e^{-\beta\epsilon_{i_2}}-e^{-\beta\epsilon_{i_1}}}{\omega^+-\epsilon_{i_1i_2}} $$
Let $\rho_a = e^{-\beta\epsilon_{i_a}}$ and define $q_a = \epsilon_{i_a} + \sum_{k=0}^{a-1}\omega_k^+$, where $\omega_0^+$ is an auxiliary variable that cancels out from all calculations.

A useful identity for nested commutators is:
$$ \underbrace{[\cdots[[A,B],B],\cdots,B]}_{n-\mathrm{times}}=\sum_{m=0}^n{n\choose m}(-1)^{n-m}B^{n-m}AB^m $$
where $\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle_0 = \mathrm{tr}(\mathcal{O}\rho_0)$.

Task:
First, show by induction that the unsymmetrized function $f^{(n)}_{i_1,\cdots,i_{n+1}}(\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_n)$ can be expressed as $\sum_{a=1}^{n+1}\rho_a\prod_{j\neq a}\frac{1}{q_a-q_j}$. Then, using this result and the provided commutator identity, derive the asymptotic expression for the $n$-th order causal response function in the limit where all frequencies are equal and tend to infinity, i.e., $\lim_{\omega\rightarrow\infty}\omega^n\chi^{(n)}_{AB}(\omega,\cdots,\omega)$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{\lim_{\omega\rightarrow\infty}\omega^n\chi^{(n)}_{AB}(\omega,\cdots,\omega)=\frac{1}{n!}\langle[\underbrace{\cdots[[A,B],B],\cdots,B]}_{n-\mathrm{times}}\rangle_0} \]

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The model-generated expression matches the ground truth very closely in structure and meaning. Both expressions have the same limit, the same factor of \( \frac{1}{n!} \), and the same nested commutator structure. The only difference is in the annotation of the number of times the commutator with \( B \) is applied:

- Ground truth: \( n \)-times nested commutator is indicated as \( n-\mathrm{times} \).
- Model: \( n \ {\rm times} \).

This is a difference in notation only, not in mathematical content.

However, the ground truth explicitly states the nested commutator as \( \underbrace{\cdots[[A,B],B],\cdots,B}_{n-\mathrm{times}} \), which means the commutator with \( B \) is applied \( n \) times after the initial \( A \). The model writes \( \underbrace{[\,[\,[A,B],B],\dots ,B]}_{n\ {\rm times}} \), which is the same meaning.

Therefore, the expressions are mathematically equivalent.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
In scalar field cosmology, the dynamics of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe with a scalar field $\phi(t)$ and a dust fluid can be analyzed using the Eisenhart-Duval lift. This technique transforms the original constrained Hamiltonian system into a set of null geodesic equations in an extended minisuperspace. For a scalar field potential $V(\phi) = \alpha(e^{\lambda\phi} + \beta)$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\lambda$ are constants, the lifted system admits additional conservation laws. These conservation laws, when projected back to the original system, manifest as nonlocal conservation laws.

For the phantom scalar field, corresponding to a scalar field parameter $\varepsilon = -1$, two such nonlocal conservation laws, $I_1$ and $I_2$, are given by:
$$I_{1} = \frac{1}{3}ap_{a}+\sqrt{\frac{\rho _{m0}}{2}}t+2\alpha \int \left( e^{\lambda \phi }+\beta \right) a^{3}dt$$
$$I_{2} = \frac{\lambda }{2}\left( \frac{a}{3}p_{a}+\sqrt{\frac{\rho _{m0}}{2}}t\right) - p_{\phi }+\lambda \int \left( \alpha \left( 2e^{\lambda \phi }+\beta \right) \right) a^{3}dt$$
where $a(t)$ is the scale factor, $p_a$ and $p_\phi$ are conjugate momenta, $\rho_{m0}$ is a constant related to the dust density, and $t$ is the cosmic time.

Task:
Determine the time-independent conserved quantity $\hat{I}$ by computing the specific linear combination $\hat{I} = I_1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}I_2$.

\subsection*{Problem 35 (Paper: 2506.21435v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
In scalar field cosmology, the evolution of the universe can be described by a system of coupled differential equations for the scale factor $a(t)$ and the scalar field $\phi(t)$. For a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) geometry, a phantom scalar field (characterized by $\varepsilon = -1$) with a potential function $V(\phi) = \alpha \left( e^{\lambda \phi} + \beta \right)$, and a dust fluid source with density $\rho_{m0}$, the cosmological field equations can be reduced to a two-equation dynamical system. Let $x(t) = a(t)^{1/3}$ and $\Phi(t) = \dot{\phi}(t)$. The system is given by:
\begin{align} \label{eq:1}
\frac{1}{3}\ddot{x} + \lambda \left( \dot{x}\Phi + x\dot{\Phi} \right) - \alpha \beta - \frac{1}{2}\rho_{m0} &= 0 \\
\frac{1}{3}\left( \ddot{x} + 2\frac{\dot{x}^{2}}{x} \right) - \lambda \left( \dot{x}\Phi + x\dot{\Phi} \right) + x\left( \alpha \beta + \varepsilon \Phi^{2} \right) + \frac{3}{2}\rho_{m0} &= 0
\end{align}
For the phantom scalar field with $\lambda = 1$ and $\varepsilon = -1$, the solutions near a movable singularity $t_0$ can be expressed as Right Laurent series expansions in powers of $T = (t-t_0)$:
$x(t) = x_0 T^{-6} + x_1 T^{-5} + x_2 T^{-4} + x_3 T^{-3} + x_4 T^{-2} + x_5 T^{-1} + x_6 T^{0} + x_7 T^{1} + x_8 T^{2} + \dots$

Here, $x_0$ and $t_0$ are integration constants, and $\Phi_0 = 2$. By substituting these series into the differential equations and collecting terms by powers of $T$, the coefficients $x_j$ and $\Phi_j$ can be determined. It is known that $x_1 = 0$, $x_3 = 0$, $x_5 = 0$, $\Phi_1 = 0$, $\Phi_3 = 0$, and $\Phi_5 = 0$. The coefficient $x_7$ is a third independent integration constant. The other coefficients are:
$x_2 = -\frac{\alpha \beta x_0}{5}$
$x_4 = \frac{17x_0}{600}(\alpha \beta)^2$
$x_6 = -\frac{1049}{189000}x_0(\alpha \beta)^3$
$\Phi_2 = -\frac{\alpha \beta}{15}$
$\Phi_4 = \frac{7}{450}(\alpha \beta)^2$
$\Phi_6 = -\frac{289}{2365}(\alpha \beta)^3$
$\Phi_7 = \frac{7x_7}{x_0}$

- The ground truth has a single fraction with a numerator involving \((\alpha \beta)^4 x_0\) and \(\rho_{m0}\), and denominator \(315000 x_0\).
- The model expression is a sum of two terms, one proportional to \(\rho_{m0}/x_0\) and the other proportional to \((\alpha \beta)^3\).
- The powers of \((\alpha \beta)\) differ: ground truth has power 4, model has power 3.
- The coefficients and denominators differ significantly.
- The model expression is not a single fraction and does not match the structure or coefficients of the ground truth.
- The model expression is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth.

\subsection*{Problem 36 (Paper: 2506.21447v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
The double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model with matter chords can be described by a chord Hilbert space. When specific constraints are imposed on this Hilbert space, the system can describe End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes in the bulk. These constraints lead to a Hamiltonian of the Al-Salam Chihara (ASC) form.
Consider a system described by the Hamiltonian $\hH_{\rm ASC}$, which acts on a Hilbert space where $\hat{\ell}$ is a length-like operator and $\hat{P}$ is its conjugate momentum. The operators satisfy the canonical commutation relation $[\hat{\ell}, \hat{P}] = \rmi \lambda$. The Hamiltonian is given by:
$$ \hH_{\rm ASC}=\frac{J}{\sqrt{\lambda(1-q)}}\qty(\rme^{-\rmi \hat{P}}+(X+Y)\rme^{-\hat{\ell}}+\qty(1-XY\rme^{-\hat{\ell}})\rme^{\rmi \hat{P}}\qty(1-\rme^{-\hat{\ell}})) $$
Here, $J$ is a coupling constant, $\lambda$ and $q$ are fixed parameters of the theory, and $X, Y$ are constant parameters.
To study spread complexity, it is useful to express the Hamiltonian in a Hermitian form. This can be achieved by a transformation of the canonical momentum operators. The resulting Hermitian Hamiltonian $\hH^{(\rm Her)}_{\rm ASC}$ is given by:
$$ \hH^{(\rm Her)}_{\rm ASC}=\frac{J}{\sqrt{\lambda(1-q)}}\biggl(\rme^{\rmi\hat{P}}\sqrt{(1-XY q^{\hat{n}-1})(1-q)} +\sqrt{(1-XY q^{\hat{n}-1})(1-q)}\rme^{-\rmi\hat{P}}+(X+Y)q^{\hat{n}}\biggr) $$
where $q^{\hat{n}}=\rme^{-\hat{\ell}}$.
The action of the momentum operator on the orthonormal basis states $\ket{K_n}$ (which are related to the chord number operator $\hat{n}$ by $\hat{n}\ket{K_n}=n\ket{K_n}$) is given by:
$$ \rme^{-\rmi\hat{P}}\ket{K_n}=\sqrt{[n+ 1]_q}\ket{K_{n+1}} $$
$$ \rme^{\rmi\hat{P}}\ket{K_n}=\sqrt{[n]_q}\ket{K_{n-1}} $$
where $[n]_q = \frac{1-q^n}{1-q}$ is the q-number.
The Lanczos algorithm defines coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ for a Hamiltonian $\hH$ and an initial state $\ket{K_0}$ (which is the state with zero chord number, $\hat{n}\ket{K_0}=0$) via the recurrence relations:
$$ \hH\ket{K_n} = a_n\ket{K_n} + b_n\ket{K_{n-1}} + b_{n+1}\ket{K_{n+1}} $$
where $b_0=0$.

Task:
Derive the expressions for the Lanczos coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ for the Hamiltonian $\hH^{(\rm Her)}_{\rm ASC}$ in terms of $J$, $\lambda$, $q$, $X$, $Y$, and $n$.

b_n = \frac{J}{\sqrt{\lambda}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - q^n}{1 - q} (1 - XY q^{n-1})}
\]
which is exactly the same as the ground truth, just written explicitly with the definition of \([n]_q\).

For \(a_n\), the ground truth is:
\[
a_n = \frac{J}{\sqrt{\lambda(1-q)}} (X + Y) q^n
\]
and the model-generated expression is:
\[
a_n = \frac{J (X+Y) q^n}{\sqrt{\lambda(1-q)}}
\]
which is exactly the same, just rearranged.

The model also adds the conditions \(n \geq 1\) and \(b_0 = 0\), which are consistent with typical definitions of \(b_n\) in such contexts and do not contradict the ground truth.

Therefore, the model-generated expressions are mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expressions, with no errors or omissions.

Background:
The doubled double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model, relevant for de Sitter holography, can be understood as two decoupled DSSYK systems. Consider one such system, described by the Hamiltonian $\hH = \frac{J}{\sqrt{\lambda(1-q)}}\qty(\rme^{-\rmi \hat{P}}+\rme^{\rmi \hat{P}}\qty(1-\rme^{-\hat{\ell}}))$. The parameters $J$ and $\lambda$ are coupling constants of the theory, and $q \in [0,1]$ is a fixed parameter. The operators $\rme^{-\rmi \hat{P}}$ and $\rme^{\rmi \hat{P}}$ are related to creation and annihilation operators $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and $\hat{a}$ respectively, such that $\hat{a}^\dagger = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q}}\rme^{-\rmi \hat{P}}$ and $\hat{a} = \sqrt{1-q}~\rme^{\rmi \hat{P}}$. The variable $\hat{\ell}$ is related to the chord number operator $\hat{n}$ by $q^{\hat{n}}=\rme^{-\hat{\ell}}$. These operators satisfy the following commutation relations: $[\hat{n},\hat{a}^\dagger]=\hat{a}^\dagger$, $[\hat{n},\hat{a}]=-\hat{a}$, and the q-commutator $[\hat{a},~\hat{a}^\dagger]_q=1$, where $[\hat{A},\hat{B}]_q = \hat{A}\hat{B} - q\hat{B}\hat{A}$. The Lanczos algorithm defines a Krylov basis $\qty{\ket{K_n}}$ for a given Hamiltonian $\hH$ and initial state $\ket{K_0}$ (where $\hat{n}\ket{K_0}=0$) via the recurrence relations: $\hH\ket{K_n} = a_n\ket{K_n} + b_n\ket{K_{n-1}} + b_{n+1}\ket{K_{n+1}}$, where $a_n$ and $b_n$ are the Lanczos coefficients.

Key points of comparison:

1. The ground truth uses \(\sqrt{[n]_q}\) with the standard q-number \([n]_q = \frac{1 - q^n}{1 - q}\).

2. The model uses a different q-number-like expression:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 - q^{2n}}{1 - q^2}}
\]
and also has an extra factor of \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q}}\) in the denominator outside the square root.

3. The model's expression is not equivalent to the ground truth expression. The model's \(b_n\) can be rewritten as:
\[
b_n = \frac{J}{\sqrt{\lambda}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - q^{2n}}{1 - q^2}} = \frac{J}{\sqrt{\lambda}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - q^{2n}}{(1-q)(1 - q^2)}}
\]
which is not the same as \(\frac{J}{\sqrt{\lambda}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - q^n}{1 - q}}\).

4. The model's expression uses \(2n\) and \(q^2\) in the q-number, which is a different q-number definition (a "q^2-number" rather than a "q-number"). This is a significant difference, not a minor typo.

5. The domain of \(n\) is slightly different: ground truth does not specify, model specifies \(n=1,2,3,\dots\) for \(b_n\), but this is a minor detail.

Conclusion:

- The model's expression is not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth.
- The difference is more than a minor coefficient or sign; it is a different q-number definition.
- Therefore, the model's expression is incorrect.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a one-dimensional quantum particle with Hamiltonian $h_x$ modeling two delta-interactions centered at points $-x/2$ and $x/2$. The operator $h_x$ acts on functions $u(y)$ and is defined by $h_x u(y) = -u''(y)$ for almost every $y \in \RE\backslash \{\pm x/2\}$. The domain of $h_x$ is given by $D(h_x):= \big\{ u \in H^2(\RE\backslash\{\pm x/2\})\cap H^1(\RE): [u'\,](\pm x/2)=\alpha u(\pm x/2)\big\}$, where $[u'](y)$ denotes the jump of the derivative $u'$ across $y$. The parameter $\alpha$ represents the strength of the interaction. The eigenvalues $z=-\lambda < 0$ of $h_x$ are determined by the condition $\det(1+\alpha\mm_{x}(z)) =0$, where $\mm_x(z)$ is a $2\times2$ matrix given by
$$
\mm_x(z) = \frac{i}{2 \sqrt{z}}\,\begin{bmatrix}
 1&   e^{i\sqrt{z}\,|x|} \,\\
  e^{i\sqrt{z}\,|x|} & 1
\end{bmatrix}, \quad \Im \sqrt z>0.
$$
This determinant condition is equivalent to the transcendental equation:
$$
\big(\alpha+2\sqrt{\lambda}\,\big)^{2} =\alpha^{2}  e^{-2\sqrt{\lambda}\,|x|}.
$$
Assume that $\alpha < 0$. For this case, the equation admits one or two solutions for $\lambda > 0$. Let $-\lambda_0(x)$ denote the lowest (most negative) eigenvalue. It is known that $\alpha^2/4 < \lambda_0(x) \leq \alpha^2$. This implies that for $\lambda_0(x)$, the term $\alpha+2\sqrt{\lambda_0(x)}$ is positive. Therefore, taking the positive square root of both sides of the transcendental equation yields:
$$
\alpha+2\sqrt{\lambda} = |\alpha| e^{-\sqrt{\lambda}|x|}.
$$
The Lambert $W$-function, $W(z)$, is defined as the solution to the equation $W(z)e^{W(z)} = z$.

Task:
Derive the explicit expression for $\lambda_0(x)$ in terms of the Lambert $W$-function.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{\lambda_0(x) = \left(\frac{ W\left(\frac{|\alpha||x|}{2} \,e^{-\frac{|\alpha||x|}{2}} \right)}{|x|} + \frac{|\alpha|}{2}\right)^{\!\!2}} \]

Comparing the two:

- The order of the two terms inside the parentheses is swapped, but addition is commutative, so this is equivalent.
- The arguments inside the Lambert W function are identical.
- The coefficients and denominators match exactly.
- The entire expression is squared in both cases.

Consider a quantum system in one dimension consisting of a light particle interacting with two heavy particles. The dynamics of the heavy particles, after applying the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and shifting the energy by $\alpha^2$, is described by an effective self-adjoint Hamiltonian $\Lscr^{\eff\bosfer}_\ve$ acting on the Hilbert space $L^2_{\bosfer}(\RE)$.

where $V(x)$ is a potential term derived from the lowest eigenvalue of the light particle's Hamiltonian, defined as $V(x) := -\lambda_0(x)+\alpha^2$. The function $\lambda_0(x)$ is given by:
$$
\lambda_0(x) = \left(\frac{ W\left(\frac{|\alpha||x|}{2} \,e^{-\frac{|\alpha||x|}{2}} \right)}{|x|} + \frac{|\alpha|}{2}\right)^{\!\!2}
$$
Here, $W(z)$ is the Lambert $W$-function, defined as the solution to $W(z)e^{W(z)} = z$. For $|x| \ll 1$, the potential $V(x)$ has the asymptotic behavior $V(x) = |\alpha|^3|x|+ O(x^2)$. The term $R(x)$ is given by $R(x) := \int_\rr |\partial_x \psi^{BO}(x,y)|^2 dy$, where $\psi^{BO}(x,y)$ is the normalized eigenfunction corresponding to $-\lambda_0(x)$.

To analyze the eigenvalues of $\Lscr^{\eff\bosfer}_\ve$ for small $\ve$, we introduce the scaling parameter $\Lambda = \ve^{-1}$. We define a scaled operator $\widetilde \Lrm_\Lambda^\bosfer = \Lambda^2 \Lscr^{\eff\bosfer}_{1/\Lambda }$. For $\Lambda \gg 1$, the eigenvalues of $\widetilde \Lrm_\Lambda^\bosfer$ are primarily determined by the dominant potential term $\Lambda^2 V(x)$, with $R(x)$ contributing to higher-order corrections.

Consider an auxiliary self-adjoint operator $\mathrm{K}^{1\bosfer}$ acting on $L^2_{\bosfer}(\RE)$, defined as:
$$
\mathrm{K}^{1\bosfer} = -\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + |\alpha|^3|x|
$$
The eigenvalues of $\mathrm{K}^{1\bosfer}$ are denoted by $e_n^{\bosfer}$, where $e_n^{\bos} = |\sigma_{2n}|\alpha^2$ for bosonic heavy particles and $e_n^{\fer} = |\sigma_{2n+1}|\alpha^2$ for fermionic heavy particles. The negative numbers $\sigma_k$ are defined such that $\Ai'(\sigma_{2n})=0$ (extrema of the Airy function $\Ai$) and $\Ai(\sigma_{2n+1})=0$ (zeros of the Airy function $\Ai$), with $\dots<\sigma_{2n+1}<\sigma_{2n}<\dots<\sigma_{1}<\sigma_{0}<0$.

Let $U_{\Lambda}$ be a unitary operator in $L^{2}_{\bosfer}(\RE)$ defined by $(U_{\Lambda}f)(x) := \Lambda^{1/3}\, f(\Lambda^{2/3} x)$.

Task:
Derive the asymptotic expansion for the $n$-th eigenvalue $\eigenvalueL^{\eff\bosfer}_{\ve, n}$ of $\Lscr^{\eff\bosfer}_\ve$ for $\ve \ll 1$.

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is:
\[
\eigenvalueL^{\eff\bosfer}_{\ve, n} = s^{\bosfer}_{n}\alpha^2 \ve^{2/3} + O (\ve)
\]

The model-generated expression is:
\[
\eigenvalueL^{\eff\bosfer}_{\varepsilon,n}
   = \varepsilon^{2/3} e^{\bosfer}_{n} + \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{4/3})
   = \varepsilon^{2/3} |\alpha|^{2} |\sigma_{2n+\delta_{\bosfer}}| + \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{4/3})
\]

Comparison:

1. The leading order term in both expressions is proportional to \(\varepsilon^{2/3}\).
2. The ground truth uses \(s^{\bosfer}_n \alpha^2\) as the coefficient, while the model uses \(e^{\bosfer}_n = |\alpha|^2 |\sigma_{2n+\delta_{\bosfer}}|\).
3. The model's coefficient is more explicit, involving \(|\alpha|^2\) and \(|\sigma_{2n+\delta_{\bosfer}}|\), which presumably corresponds to \(s^{\bosfer}_n\).
4. The ground truth error term is \(O(\varepsilon)\), while the model's error term is \(\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{4/3})\). Since \(\varepsilon^{4/3} = \varepsilon^{1 + 1/3}\) is smaller order than \(\varepsilon\), the model's error term is actually tighter (smaller) than the ground truth.
5. The model uses absolute values \(|\alpha|^2\) instead of \(\alpha^2\). If \(\alpha\) is real and positive, this is equivalent; if \(\alpha\) is complex, the ground truth might be simplified or assume \(\alpha^2\) is real positive. This is a minor difference but could be significant depending on context.
6. The model introduces \(|\sigma_{2n+\delta_{\bosfer}}|\) instead of \(s^{\bosfer}_n\). This could be a difference in notation or a more explicit form. Without further context, this is acceptable as a variable name difference.

Overall, the model expression is mathematically equivalent in form, with a more explicit coefficient and a tighter error term. The difference in the error term order is not a mistake but an improvement. The use of absolute values is a minor difference in notation or assumption.

Therefore, the model expression matches the ground truth expression exactly in mathematical content, with only minor differences in notation and a better error term.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:  

Consider the two-dimensional unit flat torus $\mathbb{T}^2 := (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^2$. Let $S'(\mathbb{T}^2)$ denote the space of Schwartz distributions on $\mathbb{T}^2$. For $s \in \mathbb{R}$, $H^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ denotes the usual fractional Sobolev space, and $\mathcal C^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ denotes the Besov-H\"older space. Let $L^2(\mathbb{T}^2)$ be the usual Lebesgue space, with inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{T}^2)}$.

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb P)$ be a standard Wiener space, where the canonical coordinate process $X^0 = (X^0_t)_{t \geq 0}$ is an $L^2(\mathbb{T}^2)$-Brownian motion. For $T \geq 0$, define the mollifier $\rho_T$ by its Fourier transform $\hat \rho_T(n) = \rho(\langle n \rangle/T)$ for $n \in \mathbb Z^2$, where $\rho \in C^\infty(\mathbb R;[0,1])$ is compactly supported on $B(0,2)$ and $\rho \equiv 1$ on $B(0,1)$, and $\langle n \rangle = \sqrt{4\pi^2|n|^2+m^2}$ for a fixed mass $m^2>0$. Define the Fourier multiplier $J_t^0$ by its symbol $\widehat{J_t^0}(n) = \frac{1}{\langle n \rangle} \sqrt{\partial_t \hat\rho_t^2(n)}$. The stochastic process $(W^0_T)_{T \geq 0}$ is defined by $W^0_T := \int_0^T J^0_t dX^0_t$. The law of $W^0_\infty := \lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} W^0_T$ is denoted by $\mu^0$, which is a centered Gaussian measure on $S'(\mathbb{T}^2)$ with covariance $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{T}^2}+m^2)^{-1/2}$.

Let $M_0 = [-1,1]\times \mathbb{T}^2$. For $\varphi^0 \in S'(\mathbb{T}^2)$, the $m$-harmonic extension $\overline H \varphi^0$ is the smooth function on $M_0$ that solves $(-\Delta+m^2) \overline H \varphi^0 = 0$ on $(-1,1)\times\mathbb{T}^2$ with boundary condition $\overline H \varphi^0|_{\{0\}\times\mathbb{T}^2} = \varphi^0$ and $\overline H \varphi^0|_{\{\pm 1\}\times\mathbb{T}^2} = 0$. For any $\varphi \in S'(M_0)$, $\varphi_T := \varphi \ast \rho_T$ denotes convolution in the periodic direction. The regularized covariance of the harmonic extension is $C_T^B(x,y) := \mathbb E_{\mu^0}[\overline H W_T^0(x) \overline H W_T^0(y)]$ for $x,y \in M_0$. The Wick powers of $\overline H W_T^0$ are defined as $\llbracket \overline H W_T^0 \rrbracket(x) = \overline H W_T^0(x)$, $\llbracket (\overline H W_T^0)^2 \rrbracket(x) = (\overline H W_T^0)^2(x) - C_T^B(x,x)$, $\llbracket (\overline H W_T^0)^3 \rrbracket(x) = (\overline H W_T^0)^3(x) - 3C_T^B(x,x)\overline H W_T^0(x)$, and $\llbracket (\overline H W_T^0)^4 \rrbracket(x) = (\overline H W_T^0)^4(x) - 6C_T^B(x,x)(\overline H W_T^0)^2(x) + 3C_T^B(x,x)^2$.

The boundary energy renormalization is $\delta^0_T := -3 \cdot 4 \int_{M_0} \int_{M_0} C_T^B(x,y)^4 dx dy$. The regularized boundary potential $V_T^0(\varphi^0)$ is defined for $\varphi^0 \in S'(\mathbb{T}^2)$ by $V_T^0(\varphi^0) = \int_{M_0} \llbracket (\overline H \varphi_T^0)^4 \rrbracket dx - \delta^0_T$. The unnormalized Laplace transform of $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{T}^2)$ under the regularized interacting boundary measure is $\mathcal Z_T^0(f) := \mathbb E_{\mu^0}[\exp(\langle f, \varphi^0 \rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{T}^2)} - V_T^0(\varphi^0))]$.

Let $\mathbb H^0$ be the space of progressively measurable processes that are $\mathbb P$-almost surely in $L^2_t L^2_z$. For $u \in \mathbb H^0$, define $Z_T^0(u) := \int_0^T J_t^0 u_t dt$. The initial variational representation of $-\log \mathcal Z_T^0(f)$ is given by:
$$-\log \mathcal Z_T^0(f) = \inf_{u \in \mathbb H^0} \mathbb E \left[ \langle f, W_T^0 + Z_T^0(u) \rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{T}^2)} + \mathcal V_T^0(W_T^0, Z_T^0(u)) + \frac 12 \|u\|_{L^2_t L^2_z}^2 \right]$$
where $\mathcal V_T^0(W_T^0, Z_T^0(u)) = \int_{M_0} 4 \llbracket (\overline H W_T^0)^3 \rrbracket \overline H Z_T^0(u) + 6 \llbracket (\overline H W_T^0)^2 \rrbracket (\overline H Z_T^0(u))^2 + 4 \overline H W_T^0 (\overline H Z_T^0(u))^3 + (\overline H Z_T^0(u))^4 \, dx - \delta^0_T$.

Let $\Xi^0_T(X^0) := ((\overline H W_t^0)_{t \leq T}, (\llbracket (\overline H W_t^0)^2 \rrbracket)_{t \leq T}, (\llbracket (\overline H W_t^0)^3 \rrbracket)_{t \leq T})$ be a vector of stochastic processes, where $\Xi^{0,1}_T(X^0) = (\overline H W_t^0)_{t \leq T}$, $\Xi^{0,2}_T(X^0) = (\llbracket (\overline H W_t^0)^2 \rrbracket)_{t \leq T}$, and $\Xi^{0,3}_T(X^0) = (\llbracket (\overline H W_t^0)^3 \rrbracket)_{t \leq T}$. Let $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak B}^0 := C_t L^4_\tau \mathcal C^{-1/2-\kappa_0'}_z \times C_t L^8_\tau \mathcal C^{-1/2-\kappa_0'}_z \times C_t L^1_\tau \mathcal C^{-1/2-\kappa_0'}_z$ for some small $\kappa_0'>0$. Let $\mathcal L^0 := L^2_t W^{1/2-\kappa_0',2+\kappa_0''}_z$ for some small $\kappa_0''>0$. Let $\mathbb L^0$ be the space of progressively measurable processes that are almost surely in $\mathcal L^0$. Define the boundary remainder map $\ell^0_T: \boldsymbol{\mathfrak B}^0 \times \mathcal L^0 \rightarrow \mathcal L^0$ by $\ell^0_T(\Xi^0, u)_t := 4J_t^0 \overline H^* \Xi^{0,3}_t \mathbbm 1_{t \leq T} + u_t$.

Task:
Derive the expression for the renormalized boundary cost function $\mathbb F^{0,f}_T(u)$ such that $-\log \mathcal Z_T^0(f) = \inf_{u \in \mathbb L^0} \mathbb F^{0,f}_T(u)$.

    \Bigg]\;

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

Let's compare the two expressions term-by-term:

1. **Inner product term:**
   - Ground truth: \(\langle f, Z^0_T(u) \rangle_{L^2_z}\)
   - Model: \(\langle f, Z^0_T(u) \rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{T}^2)}\)

   The ground truth specifies the inner product over \(L^2_z\), while the model uses \(L^2(\mathbb{T}^2)\). Since the domain in the integral is \([-1,1] \times \mathbb{T}^2\), the variable \(z\) presumably corresponds to \(\mathbb{T}^2\). This is a minor difference in notation but not a substantive error.

2. **Integral term:**
   - Ground truth integral is over \([-1,1] \times \mathbb{T}^2\).
   - Model integral is over \(M_0\), which is presumably the same domain (though not explicitly stated).
   - The integrand terms match exactly: 
     - \(6 \Xi^{0,2}_T(X^0) (\overline H Z^0_T(u))^2\)
     - \(4 \Xi^{0,1}_T(X^0) (\overline H Z^0_T(u))^3\)
     - \((\overline H Z^0_T(u))^4\)

   The model writes the last term as \([\overline H Z^0_T(u)(x)]^4\) inside the integral, while the ground truth writes the \(L^4\) norm of \(\overline H Z^0_T(u)\) over the domain separately. This is a significant difference: the ground truth separates the \(L^4\) norm term outside the integral, while the model includes the fourth power inside the integral.

   However, the \(L^4\) norm to the fourth power is exactly the integral of the fourth power over the domain, so these are mathematically equivalent.

3. **Norm term:**
   - Ground truth: \(\frac{1}{2} \|\ell^0_T(\Xi^0_T(X^0), u)\|_{L^2_t L^2_z}^2\)
   - Model: \(\frac{1}{2} \|u\|_{L^2_t L^2_z}^2\)

   This is a significant difference. The ground truth has the norm of \(\ell^0_T(\Xi^0_T(X^0), u)\), which is a function of \(\Xi^0_T(X^0)\) and \(u\), while the model simply has the norm of \(u\) itself. This is not a minor difference; it changes the meaning of the term.

**Summary:**

- The inner product domain difference is minor and acceptable.
- The integral domain notation is minor.
- The placement of the fourth power term is mathematically equivalent.
- The last norm term is significantly different: the model omits the operator \(\ell^0_T(\Xi^0_T(X^0), \cdot)\) and replaces it with just \(u\).

Because of this last difference, the model expression is not fully correct.

**Score: 0.5**

The model expression is very close but misses the key operator \(\ell^0_T(\Xi^0_T(X^0), \cdot)\) in the last norm term, which is a nontrivial omission.

\subsection*{Problem 41 (Paper: 2506.21466v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:  
Let $\mathbb{T}^2 = (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^2$ denote the two-dimensional unit flat torus, and let $m^2 > 0$ be a fixed mass parameter. Let $S'(\mathbb{T}^2)$ be the space of Schwartz distributions on $\mathbb{T}^2$. Consider a probability measure $\nu^0$ on $S'(\mathbb{T}^2)$. Define the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H} = L^2(\nu^0)$.

For any $\tau > 0$, let $\mathcal{A}_\tau: S'(\mathbb{T}^2) \times S'(\mathbb{T}^2) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a measurable map, referred to as the $\varphi^4_3$ amplitude. This amplitude satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Positivity: $\mathcal{A}_\tau(\varphi, \varphi') > 0$ for $\nu^0 \otimes \nu^0$-almost surely $(\varphi, \varphi')$.
    \item Gluing Property: For any $\tau_1, \tau_2 > 0$ and $\varphi_1, \varphi_3 \in S'(\mathbb{T}^2)$,
    $$ \mathcal{A}_{\tau_1+\tau_2}(\varphi_1, \varphi_3) = \mathbb{E}_{\nu^0}[\mathcal{A}_{\tau_1}(\varphi_1, \varphi_2) \mathcal{A}_{\tau_2}(\varphi_2, \varphi_3)] $$
    where $\varphi_2$ is a random variable sampled according to $\nu^0$.
    \item Square Integrability: For any $\tau > 0$, the amplitude is square-integrable with respect to $\nu^0 \otimes \nu^0$, i.e.,
    $$ \int_{S'(\mathbb{T}^2)} \int_{S'(\mathbb{T}^2)} \mathcal{A}_\tau(\varphi, \varphi')^2 \nu^0(\mathd\varphi) \nu^0(\mathd\varphi') < \infty $$
    Furthermore, there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for any $\tau > 0$,
    $$ \int_{S'(\mathbb{T}^2)} \int_{S'(\mathbb{T}^2)} \mathcal{A}_\tau(\varphi, \varphi')^2 \nu^0(\mathd\varphi) \nu^0(\mathd\varphi') \leq e^{C\tau} $$
\end{enumerate}

Define a family of linear operators $(\mathbf{P}_\tau)_{\tau \geq 0}$ on $\mathcal{H}$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For $\tau > 0$, $\mathbf{P}_\tau$ acts on $f \in \mathcal{H}$ by
    $$ \mathbf{P}_\tau f(\varphi) = \int_{S'(\mathbb{T}^2)} f(\varphi') \mathcal{A}_\tau(\varphi, \varphi') \nu^0(\mathd\varphi') $$
    \item For $\tau = 0$, $\mathbf{P}_0 = \mathrm{Id}_{\mathcal{H}}$ (the identity operator on $\mathcal{H}$).
\end{itemize}
It is known that $(\mathbf{P}_\tau)_{\tau \geq 0}$ forms a strongly continuous semigroup on $\mathcal{H}$. Let $\mathbf{H}$ be the infinitesimal generator of this semigroup, so $\mathbf{P}_\tau = e^{-\tau \mathbf{H}}$. The spectrum of $\mathbf{H}$, denoted $\sigma(\mathbf{H})$, is known to be bounded from below, i.e., there exists $E_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\sigma(\mathbf{H}) \subset [E_0, \infty)$. For any $\alpha \in \mathbb{C} \setminus [E_0, \infty)$, the resolvent operator is defined as $\mathbf{R}_\alpha = (\mathbf{H} - \alpha)^{-1}$.

Task:
Derive the property of the spectrum of $\mathbf{H}$ that implies it consists solely of eigenvalues with finite multiplicity.

E_n\!\uparrow\!\infty,\; \text{each }E_n\text{ an eigenvalue of finite multiplicity}\;

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth states that the spectrum of \(\mathbf{H}\) is discrete, consists of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, and the associated eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis of \(\mathcal{H}\).

The model-generated expression states that \(\mathbf{H}\) has compact resolvent, which implies the spectrum \(\sigma(\mathbf{H}) = \{E_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) is discrete, with eigenvalues \(E_n\) tending to infinity, each of finite multiplicity.

The model expression correctly captures the discreteness of the spectrum, the eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, and the fact that the eigenvalues tend to infinity. However, it does not explicitly mention that the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis of \(\mathcal{H}\), which is a crucial part of the spectral theorem for compact resolvent operators on Hilbert spaces.

Since the model expression is missing this important part about the eigenvectors forming an orthonormal basis, it is not fully correct. However, it is very close and captures the main spectral properties.

Therefore, the model expression deserves partial credit.

\subsection*{Problem 42 (Paper: 2506.21496v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
The octonion algebra $\mathbb{O}$ is a real 8-dimensional nonassociative algebra with a unit element $e_0$ and seven imaginary basis elements $e_i$ for $i=1,\dots,7$. The product of any two basis elements $e_I, e_J \in \{e_0, \dots, e_7\}$ is given by $e_I e_J = f^K_{IJ} e_K$, where $f^K_{IJ}$ are the structure constants. The octonions are an alternative algebra, meaning the associator $[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz)$ changes sign under the exchange of any two elements.

Consider a finite-dimensional, unital, alternative algebra $A = \bigoplus_{a=1}^n \mathbb{O}$, where each $A_a$ is a copy of the octonion algebra $\mathbb{O}$. We denote the basis elements of $A$ as $e^{(a)I} := (0, \dots, e^I, \dots, 0)$, where $e^I$ is the $I$-th basis element of the $a$-th octonion factor.

Let $M = A \otimes A$ be a real vector space. $M$ is equipped with left and right $A$-actions, denoted by $\cdot$, which are inherited from the octonion product. For $c_{(k)} \in A_k$ and $u \otimes^{(lm)} v \in A_l \otimes A_m$ (where $u \otimes^{(lm)} v$ denotes an element of the $A_l \otimes A_m$ component of $M$), these actions are defined as:
$c_{(k)}\cdot (u\otimes^{(lm)} v)=\hat{\delta}^l_k(cu\otimes^{(lm)} v)$
$(u\otimes^{(lm)} v)\cdot c_{(k)}=\hat{\delta}^m_k(u\otimes^{(lm)} vc)$
where $\hat{\delta}^l_k$ is the Kronecker delta, and $cu$ and $vc$ denote the octonion product within the respective factors. This type of bimodule is called a split alternative bimodule.

A linear map $\Delta: A \rightarrow M$ is called a derivation if it satisfies the Leibniz rule:
$\Delta[xy] = \Delta[x]\cdot y + x\cdot \Delta[y]$
for all $x,y \in A$. We are interested in derivations where the input elements $x,y$ are imaginary octonion basis elements. A general linear operator $\Delta: A \rightarrow M$ can be expressed in terms of the basis elements as:
$\Delta[e^{(a)i}] = \sum_{b,c=1}^n \sum_{J,K=0}^7 \Delta^{(a)i}_{(bc)JK} e^J\otimes^{bc}e^K$
where $\Delta^{(a)i}_{(bc)JK}$ are real coefficients, $i \in \{1, \dots, 7\}$ (imaginary input index), and $J,K \in \{0, \dots, 7\}$ (output indices, including the identity $e_0$).

Applying the Leibniz rule to $\Delta[e^{(a)i}e^{(b)j}]$ (where $i,j \in \{1, \dots, 7\}$ are imaginary indices) and equating the coefficients of $e^J \otimes^{cd} e^K$ on both sides yields the following condition on the coefficients $\Delta^{(a)i}_{(bc)JK}$:
$\hat{\delta}^{ab} f^L_{ij} \Delta^{(a)L}_{(cd)JK} = \Delta^{(a)i}_{(cd)JS} \hat{\delta}^d_b f^K_{SK} + \Delta^{(b)j}_{(cd)SJ} \hat{\delta}^c_a f^K_{iS}$
where $f^L_{ij}$ are the structure constants of the octonions, and Einstein's summation convention is used for repeated indices $L,S$ (but not for bracketed indices like $(ab)$ or $(cd)$). This equation must hold for all combinations of indices and factors.

Task:
1.  Show that if $c \neq a=b \neq d$, the Leibniz rule implies that the coefficients $\Delta^{(a)L}_{(cd)JK}$ must be zero for all $L,J,K$. This means that $\Delta[e^{(a)i}]$ can only have non-zero components in $A_a \otimes A_c$ or $A_c \otimes A_a$ for some $c$.
2.  Given that for the case where $a=b=c=d$, the non-zero coefficients are $\Delta^{(a)i}_{(aa)i0} = \kappa_{(aa)}$ and $\Delta^{(a)i}_{(aa)0i} = -\kappa_{(aa)}$, where $\kappa_{(aa)}$ is an arbitrary real constant.
3.  Given that for the cases where $c=a \neq b=d$, $a=b=c \neq d$, and $a=b=d \neq c$, the non-zero coefficients are $\Delta^{(c)i}_{(ab)i0} = \kappa_{(ab)}\hat{\delta}^{ca}$ and $\Delta^{(c)i}_{(ba)0i} = -\kappa_{(ba)}\hat{\delta}^{bc}$, where $\kappa_{(ab)}$ and $\kappa_{(ba)}$ are arbitrary real constants.
4.  Combine these results to express the general form of $\Delta[e^{(a)i}]$ for any $a \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ and imaginary index $i \in \{1, \dots, 7\}$.

1. **Summation index:** Ground truth sums over \( c \), model sums over \( b \). This is just a dummy index difference, acceptable.

2. **Coefficients:** Both have \(\kappa_{(ac)}\) and \(\kappa_{(ca)}\) (ground truth) vs \(\kappa_{(ab)}\) and \(\kappa_{(ba)}\) (model). This matches the dummy index change.

3. **Tensor factors:**
   - Ground truth has \( e^i \otimes^{ac} e^0 \) and \( e^0 \otimes^{ca} e^i \).
   - Model has \( e^{(a)i} \otimes^{(ab)} e_0 \) and \( e_0 \otimes^{(ba)} e^{(a)i} \).

   Here, the model uses \( e^{(a)i} \) instead of \( e^i \), and \( e_0 \) instead of \( e^0 \).

4. **Index notation:**
   - The ground truth uses \( e^i \) and \( e^0 \) without the \((a)\) superscript on \( e^i \).
   - The model uses \( e^{(a)i} \) consistently.

   This is a difference in notation, but if \( e^{(a)i} \) corresponds to \( e^i \) in the ground truth, this is acceptable.

5. **Subscript vs superscript on \( e_0 \) vs \( e^0 \):**
   - Ground truth uses \( e^0 \).
   - Model uses \( e_0 \).

   This is a significant difference: \( e^0 \) and \( e_0 \) are generally not the same object (covariant vs contravariant components). This is a nontrivial difference.

6. **Tensor product superscripts:**
   - Ground truth uses \(\otimes^{ac}\) and \(\otimes^{ca}\).
   - Model uses \(\otimes^{(ab)}\) and \(\otimes^{(ba)}\).

   This is consistent with the dummy index change.

7. **Extra index range \( i=1,\ldots,7 \) in model:**
   - Ground truth does not specify this, but this is likely context-dependent and not an error.

Summary:

- The main discrepancy is the use of \( e_0 \) instead of \( e^0 \).
- Also, the model uses \( e^{(a)i} \) instead of \( e^i \), but this may be just notation.
- The difference between \( e_0 \) and \( e^0 \) is more than a minor notation difference; it changes the nature of the vector.

Given that, the model expression has one significant error (covariant vs contravariant index on \( e^0 \)).

No other errors are apparent.

According to the rubric:

- One minor error (one wrong sign, missing variable, or minor constant) gets 0.5.
- More than one minor error or a significant error gets 0.

Is the difference between \( e_0 \) and \( e^0 \) a minor error? It is more than a minor error because it changes the object.

Therefore, the model expression is not completely correct, but it is very close.

I would assign 0.5 for partial correctness.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider an internal spectral geometry defined by a triple $T_F = (A_F, H_F, D_F)$. The internal coordinate algebra is $A_F = \mathbb{O}\oplus \mathbb{O}$, where $\mathbb{O}$ denotes the octonion algebra. The Hilbert space is $H_F = A_F$, equipped with a natural inner product derived from the octonionic norm. The left and right actions of $A_F$ on $H_F$ are given by $\pi_L(a) = \begin{pmatrix} L_{a_1} & 0 \\ 0 & L_{a_2} \end{pmatrix}$ and $\pi_R(a) = \begin{pmatrix} R_{a_1} & 0 \\ 0 & R_{a_2} \end{pmatrix}$ for $a=(a_1,a_2)\in A_F$, where $L_x y = xy$ and $R_x y = yx$ for $x,y\in\mathbb{O}$. These actions satisfy the alternative identities:
\begin{align*}
\pi_L(ab)&=\pi_L(a)\pi_L(b) +[\pi_L(a),\pi_R(b)] \\
\pi_R(ab)&=\pi_R(b)\pi_R(a)+[\pi_R(b),\pi_L(a)] \\
[\pi_L(a),\pi_R(b)]&=[\pi_R(a),\pi_L(b)]
\end{align*}
for all $a,b\in A_F$. The octonion algebra is involutive, with $x^* = x_0 e_0 - \sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i$ for $x = x_0 e_0 + \sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i \in \mathbb{O}$. This involution extends to $H_F$ via the operator $J_F = \begin{pmatrix} j & 0 \\ 0 & j \end{pmatrix}$, where $j(x) = x^*$. The right action $\pi_R(a)$ can be expressed in terms of the left action and $J_F$ as $\pi_R(a) = J_F\pi_L(a)^*J_F$, where $\pi_L(a)^*$ denotes the adjoint (transpose) of the operator $\pi_L(a)$ on $H_F$.

The Dirac operator $D_F: H_F \rightarrow H_F$ is a Hermitian operator of the general form $D_F = M_{IJ}\begin{pmatrix} 0 & e_I\otimes e_J^\ast \\ e_J\otimes e_I^\ast & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, where $e_I$ are octonion basis elements ($I=0,...,7$) and $\ast$ denotes the dual with respect to the Hilbert space. The Dirac operator is required to satisfy the constraint $D_F J_F = \epsilon_F' J_F D_F$ for some $\epsilon_F' = \pm 1$. The external derivation $\Delta_D: A_F \rightarrow End(H_F)$ is defined as $\Delta_D(a) = [D_F, \pi_L(a)]$. This derivation must satisfy the Leibniz rule:
\begin{align*}
\Delta_D(ab) = \Delta_D(a)\cdot b + a\cdot\Delta_D(b)
\end{align*}
for some left and right bimodule actions $\cdot: A_F \otimes \Omega_D^1 A_F \rightarrow \Omega_D^1 A_F$ and $\cdot: \Omega_D^1 A_F \otimes A_F \rightarrow \Omega_D^1 A_F$, where $\Omega_D^1 A_F$ is the space of 1-forms generated by elements of the form $\Delta_D(a)$. Using the alternative identities, the expression for $\Delta_D(ab)$ can be expanded as:
\begin{align*}
\Delta_D(ab) &= \Delta_D(a)\pi_L(b) + \pi_L(a)\Delta_D(b) + [D_F,(1-S)[\pi_L(a),\pi_R(b)] +S[\pi_R(a),\pi_L(b)]]
\end{align*}
for some parameter $S \in \mathbb{R}$. The space of 1-forms $\Omega_D^1 A_F$ is also equipped with an involution $\omega^* = \omega^T$ (transpose of the operator $\omega \in End(H_F)$). For the representation to be involutive, the left and right actions must be related by $\omega \cdot a = (a^* \cdot \omega^*)^*$.

Task:
Derive the explicit expressions for the left and right bimodule actions, $a \cdot \omega$ and $\omega \cdot a$, for $\omega \in \Omega_D^1 A_F$ and $a \in A_F$, such that the Leibniz rule for $\Delta_D$ is satisfied and the representation is involutive.

\omega\cdot a &= \omega\pi_L(a) +\frac{1}{2}[\omega,J_F\pi_L(a)^*J_F] -\frac{\epsilon_F'}{2}[J_F\omega^*J_F,\pi_L(a)]

because the alternative identities give [π_L(a),π_R(b)]=[π_R(a),π_L(b)].

\subsection*{Problem 44 (Paper: 2506.21498v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a two-player, two-strategy symmetric game with strategies $\mathbf{C}$ (cooperation) and $\mathbf{D}$ (defection). The payoffs for Player 1 are given by the matrix:
$$
	\begin{array}{c|cc}
		&\mathbf{\;C\;} &\mathbf{\;D\;}\\
		\hline
		\mathbf{\;C\;} &1 &-B \\
		\mathbf{\;D\;} &1-A &0 \\
	\end{array}
$$
where $A$ and $B$ are real-valued parameters. Player 1 chooses a row, and Player 2 chooses a column. The game is symmetric, meaning Player 2's payoffs are obtained by transposing this matrix.

Players update their strategies using introspection dynamics. At each discrete time step, one player is chosen uniformly at random (Player 1 or Player 2, each with probability $1/2$) to revise their strategy. The chosen player compares their current payoff $\pi$ with the payoff $\pi'$ they would obtain by switching to the other strategy, assuming the co-player's strategy remains fixed. The player switches to the alternative strategy with a probability given by the Fermi function:
$$
\phi(\Delta\pi) = \frac{1}{1+{\rm e}^{-\beta_i\, \Delta\pi}}
$$
where $\Delta\pi = \pi' - \pi$ is the payoff difference, and $\beta_i \ge 0$ is the selection strength of player $i$. Player 1 has selection strength $\beta_1$, and Player 2 has selection strength $\beta_2$.

The system can be described as a Markov chain with four states representing the joint strategies: $\textbf{CC}$, $\textbf{CD}$, $\textbf{DC}$, and $\textbf{DD}$ (where the first letter denotes Player 1's strategy and the second denotes Player 2's strategy). This Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution $\mathbf{u}(A, B, \beta_1, \beta_2) = (u_{\textbf{CC}}, u_{\textbf{CD}}, u_{\textbf{DC}}, u_{\textbf{DD}})$, which represents the average frequency of each game outcome over many rounds.

The model-generated expression, however, is a set of four scalar expressions \(u_{\mathbf{CC}}, u_{\mathbf{CD}}, u_{\mathbf{DC}}, u_{\mathbf{DD}}\) defined in terms of variables \(p_1, p_2, r_1, r_2, K, Z\). There is no direct correspondence or mapping shown between these variables and the parameters \(A, B, \beta_1, \beta_2\) or the exponential terms in the ground truth. The model expression does not resemble the ground truth expression in form or content.

Since the model expression is completely different in structure and variables, and does not match or approximate the ground truth expression, it cannot be considered correct or partially correct.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a two-player, two-strategy symmetric game where players can choose between strategy $\mathbf{C}$ (cooperation) and $\mathbf{D}$ (defection). The payoffs for player 1 are given by the following matrix, where player 1 chooses a row and player 2 chooses a column:

	\end{array}
\end{equation*}
Players adapt their strategies over time using introspection dynamics. In this process, a player compares their current payoff $\pi$ with the payoff $\pi'$ they would obtain by switching to the alternative strategy (while the co-player's strategy remains fixed). The probability of switching to the alternative strategy is given by the Fermi function:
\begin{equation*}
	\phi=\frac{1}{1+{\rm e}^{-\beta_i\, (\pi' - \pi)}}.
\end{equation*}
Here, $\beta_i \ge 0$ represents player $i$'s selection strength. This learning process is iterated over many time steps, leading to a stationary distribution of the four possible game outcomes: $\mathbf{CC}$, $\mathbf{CD}$, $\mathbf{DC}$, and $\mathbf{DD}$ (where the first letter denotes player 1's strategy and the second denotes player 2's). Let $u_{\textbf{CC}}$, $u_{\textbf{CD}}$, $u_{\textbf{DC}}$, and $u_{\textbf{DD}}$ be the stationary frequencies of these outcomes.

When both players have the same selection strength, $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta$, the stationary distribution simplifies to:
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{u}(A, B, \beta, \beta)= \frac{1}{2 + e^{A \beta} + e^{B \beta}}(e^{A \beta},1,1,e^{B \beta}).
\end{equation*}
Player 1's average payoff, denoted $\Pi_{\beta_2}(\beta_1)$, is computed by multiplying the stationary frequencies with the respective stage game payoffs:
\begin{equation*}
\Pi_{\beta_2}(\beta_1) = 1 \cdot u_\textbf{CC} -B\cdot u_\textbf{CD} +(1-\!A)\cdot u_\textbf{DC}+0\cdot u_\textbf{DD}.
\end{equation*}
In the context of adaptive dynamics, the selection strength $\beta$ is an evolving trait. We consider a monomorphic resident population where all individuals have a selection strength $x$. The average payoff of a resident player in this population is denoted $\Pi_x(x)$. This quantity is a crucial component in determining the fitness of mutant traits.

Task: Derive the analytical expression for player 1's average payoff $\Pi_x(x)$ in a monomorphic population where both players have the same selection strength $x$.

The ground truth numerator is \( e^{A x} - A - B + 1 \), while the model's numerator is \( e^{A x} + 1 - A - B \).

Since addition is commutative, \( e^{A x} + 1 - A - B \) is mathematically equivalent to \( e^{A x} - A - B + 1 \).

The denominator is exactly the same in both expressions.

\subsection*{Problem 46 (Paper: 2506.21529v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
The behavior of a Dirac electron in graphene under an external magnetic field is described by the Dirac Hamiltonian $H = v_F \mathbf{\alpha} \cdot (\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A} )$, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity, $\mathbf{\alpha} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y)$ are Pauli matrices, $\mathbf{p} = (p_x, p_y)$ is the momentum operator, and $\mathbf{A} = (A_x, A_y)$ is the vector potential. For a Dirac wavefunction $\Psi = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{pmatrix}$, the equation $H \Psi = E \Psi$ leads to a second-order differential equation for the component $\psi_2(\mathbf{r})$. Defining $\mathcal{P} = p_x + i p_y$ and $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{r}) = A_x(\mathbf{r}) + i A_y (\mathbf{r})$, this equation is $v_F^2 \big[(\mathcal{P} + \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{r})) (\mathcal{P}^* + \mathcal{A}^*(\mathbf{r}))\big] \psi_2(\mathbf{r}) = E^2 \psi_2(\mathbf{r})$. Explicitly, this can be written as:
$\bigg[ p_x^2 + p_y^2 + A_x^2 + A_y^2 + 2 (A_x p_x + A_y p_y) + (p_xA_x) + (p_yA_y) + i (p_y A_x) - i (p_x A_y) \bigg] \psi_2(x,y) = \bigg( \frac{E^2 }{v_F^2} \bigg) \psi_2(x,y)$.
Consider a magnetic field in the symmetric gauge, where the vector potential components are given by $A_x(x,y) = - By f(r)$ and $A_y(x,y) = Bx f(r)$, with $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ being the radial variable and $B$ a constant. The magnetic field $B_z(r)$ is defined as $B_z(r) = \frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}$.
When transforming to polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ and using the ansatz $\psi_2(r,\theta) = r^{-1/2} e^{im_l \theta} \chi(r)$, the equation for $\psi_2$ reduces to a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger-like equation for $\chi(r)$:
$- \frac{d^2 \chi(r)}{dr^2} + V_{m_l}(r) \chi(r) = \bigg( \frac{E^2 }{v_F^2} \bigg) \chi(r)$, where the effective potential is $V_{m_l}(r) = B^2 r^2 f(r)^2 + \frac{m_l^2 - \frac{1}{4}}{r^2} + 2 B \bigg( f(r) m_l - f(r) - \frac{r f'(r)}{2}\bigg)$.
For $m_l \leq 0$, this equation can be factorized using the operator $\mathcal{A}_{m_l} = \frac{d}{d r} + B r f(r) - \frac{|m_l| + \frac{1}{2}}{r}$. The ground-state eigenfunction $\chi_{0,m_l}(r)$ satisfies $\mathcal{A}_{m_l} \chi_{0,m_l}(r) = 0$, which yields $\chi_{0,m_l}(r) = N_{m_l} e^{- \int^r B r' f(r') dr'} r^{|m_l| + \frac{1}{2}}$, where $N_{m_l}$ is a normalization factor.
The Abraham-Moses construction states that if $V(x)$ is a potential with ground-state wavefunction $\psi_0(x)$, then a new potential $\tilde{V}_\lambda(x) = V(x) - 2 \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \ln [J(x) + \lambda]$ is strictly isospectral to $V(x)$, where $J(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x \psi_0(x')^2 dx'$ and $\lambda$ is a real constant. In the context of the effective potential $V_{m_l}(r)$ and its ground-state eigenfunction $\chi_{0,m_l}(r)$, this transformation implies a new function $f_{m_l,\lambda}(r)$ for the vector potential, related to the original $f(r)$ by: $B f_{m_l,\lambda}(r) = B f(r) + \frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{d r} \ln [J_{m_l}(r) + \lambda]$, where $J_{m_l}(r) = \int_0^r \chi_{0,m_l}(r')^2 dr'$.

Task:
Derive the expression for the non-uniform magnetic field $(B_z)_{m_l,\gamma}(r)$ that supports the Landau levels, given that the original magnetic field is uniform (i.e., $f(r)=1$). Express your result in terms of $B$, $r$, $m_l$, and a real constant $\gamma = \lambda/N_{m_l}^2$.

\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
A Dirac electron in graphene is described by the two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian \(H = v_F \mathbf{\alpha} \cdot (\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A})\), where \(v_F\) is the Fermi velocity, \(\mathbf{\alpha} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y)\) are Pauli matrices, \(\mathbf{p} = (p_x, p_y)\) is the momentum operator, and \(\mathbf{A} = (A_x, A_y)\) is the vector potential. The electronic charge is taken as \(-1\).
Consider the asymmetric (Landau) gauge, where \(A_x = 0\) and \(A_y = A_y(x)\). The Dirac wavefunction is taken in the form \(\Psi = e^{iky} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_1(x) \\ i \psi_2(x) \end{pmatrix}\), where \(k\) is a continuous momentum quantum number.
The Dirac equation \(H \Psi = E \Psi\) leads to a Schr\"odinger-like equation for \(\psi_2(x)\) with an effective potential \(V_k(x)\) given by:
\(V_k(x) = [k + A_y(x)]^2 - \frac{dA_y(x)}{dx}\).
For a uniform magnetic field \(B_z = B\), the vector potential is \(A_y(x) = Bx\). In this case, the ground-state eigenfunction \(\psi_{2,0,k}(x)\) (corresponding to \(n=0\)) is given by \(\psi_{2,0,k}(x) = N_k e^{-\frac{B (x + k/B)^2}{2}}\), where \(N_k\) is a normalization factor.
The Abraham-Moses construction provides a family of strictly isospectral potentials \(\tilde{V}_\lambda(x)\) related to an initial potential \(V(x)\) by the formula:
\( \tilde{V}_\lambda(x) = V(x) - 2 \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \ln [J(x) + \lambda] \),
where \(J(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x \psi_0(x')^2 dx'\) and \(\psi_0(x)\) is the ground-state eigenfunction of the initial potential \(V(x)\). Here, \(\lambda\) is a real constant.

Task:
Derive the expression for the strictly isospectral effective potential \(\tilde{V}_{k,\lambda}(x)\) for the Dirac electron in the asymmetric gauge, using the uniform magnetic field \(B_z = B\) as the initial configuration. Assume the normalization factor \(N_k\) is absorbed into \(\lambda\), so \(J_k(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-B (x' + k/B)^2} dx'\).

\end{aligned}

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is:
\[
\tilde{V}_{k,\lambda}(x) = (k+Bx)^2 - B - 2 \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \ln \left[ \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-B (x' + k/B)^2} dx' + \lambda \right]
\]

The model-generated expression is:
\[
\tilde{V}_{k,\lambda}(x) = (k+Bx)^2 - B + \frac{4B (x + k/B) e^{-B(x + k/B)^2}}{J_k(x) + \lambda} + \frac{2 e^{-2B(x + k/B)^2}}{(J_k(x) + \lambda)^2}
\]
where
\[
J_k(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-B(x' + k/B)^2} dx' = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2\sqrt{B}} \left[ 1 + \operatorname{erf}(\sqrt{B}(x + k/B)) \right].
\]

---

**Comparison and analysis:**

1. The model starts from the ground truth expression and rewrites the second derivative of the logarithm explicitly using the known formula for the second derivative of a log function:
\[
-2 \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \ln[f(x)] = -2 \left( \frac{f''}{f} - \left(\frac{f'}{f}\right)^2 \right) = 2 \left( \left(\frac{f'}{f}\right)^2 - \frac{f''}{f} \right).
\]

2. The model's expression matches the ground truth in the first two terms: \((k+Bx)^2 - B\).

3. The integral inside the logarithm is correctly identified as \(J_k(x)\).

4. The model expands the second derivative term explicitly, giving the additional terms involving \(e^{-B(x + k/B)^2}\) and its powers divided by \(J_k(x) + \lambda\).

5. The model's expression is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expression, just written in a more explicit form.

6. The model also provides the closed form of the integral \(J_k(x)\) in terms of the error function, which is consistent and correct.

7. There are no sign errors, missing terms, or incorrect coefficients.

---

**Conclusion:**

The model-generated expression is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth expression, just expanded explicitly. It matches perfectly in all aspects.

\subsection*{Problem 48 (Paper: 2506.21540v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a one-dimensional quantum spin chain described by a continuum field theory in terms of a unit vector $\vec{n}(x,t) = (\sqrt{1-\psi(x,t)^2}\, \cos\theta(x,t),\sqrt{1-\psi(x,t)^2}\,\sin\theta(x,t),\psi(x,t))$, where $x$ is the spatial coordinate and $t$ is imaginary time. Here, $\theta(x,t)$ is the azimuthal angle in the $xy$-plane, and $\psi(x,t)$ is the $z$-component of the spin, $n_z$. The action for the isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet with spin magnitude $S$ and exchange coupling $\mathcal{J}$ is given by $\mathcal{S} = \int \dd x \dd t \, \mathcal{L}$, where the Lagrangian density is
$$ \mathcal{L} = -i S (1-\psi) \partial_t \theta - \frac{\mathcal{J}S^2}{2} \left( \frac{(\nabla \psi)^2}{1-\psi^2} + (1-\psi^2)(\nabla\theta)^2 \right) $$
The system is subject to U(1) spin rotation symmetry around the $S^z$ axis, spatial translation and reflection symmetries, and a discrete symmetry that reverses the sign of $S^z$ (e.g., time-reversal symmetry). Generic perturbations respecting these symmetries are added to the Hamiltonian.

Task:
Derive the effective Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}'$ for the critical theory by performing the following steps: (1) Expand the given Lagrangian density to quadratic order in the fields $\psi(x,t)$ and $\theta(x,t)$ and their derivatives, neglecting total derivative terms. (2) Identify the lowest-order potential terms in $\psi(x,t)$ that are allowed by the specified symmetries. (3) Combine these terms to form the full Lagrangian density. (4) Rescale the spatial coordinate $x$ by $x_0 = \mathcal{J}^{1/2}S$ and the imaginary time $t$ by $t_0 = S$, and absorb all resulting constant prefactors into the redefined coupling constants $\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_4$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{\mathcal{L}'=
 i  \, \psi \partial_t \theta
+  \f{1}{2}
(\nabla\theta)^2 
+  \f{1}{2}
(\nabla \psi)^2 
 + \lambda_2 \psi^2 
+  \lambda_4 \psi^4} \]

\;-\;\frac12\!\left[(\partial_{x}\theta)^2+(\partial_{x}\psi)^2\right]
\;+\;\lambda_{2}\,\psi^{2}\;+\;\lambda_{4}\,\psi^{4}\;

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The ground truth expression is:
\[
\mathcal{L}' = i \psi \partial_t \theta + \frac{1}{2} (\nabla \theta)^2 + \frac{1}{2} (\nabla \psi)^2 + \lambda_2 \psi^2 + \lambda_4 \psi^4
\]

The model-generated expression is:
\[
\mathcal{L}' = i \psi \partial_t \theta - \frac{1}{2} \left[ (\partial_x \theta)^2 + (\partial_x \psi)^2 \right] + \lambda_2 \psi^2 + \lambda_4 \psi^4
\]

Key points of comparison:

1. **Sign in front of the gradient terms:**  
   - Ground truth has **+ (1/2)(\nabla \theta)^2 + (1/2)(\nabla \psi)^2**  
   - Model has **- (1/2) [(\partial_x \theta)^2 + (\partial_x \psi)^2]**

   The sign is opposite, which is a significant error.

2. **Gradient operator:**  
   - Ground truth uses \(\nabla\), which implies the full spatial gradient (all spatial dimensions).  
   - Model uses only \(\partial_x\), i.e., derivative with respect to one spatial coordinate only.

   This is a simplification or omission of other spatial derivatives, which is a notable difference.

3. **Other terms:**  
   - The \(i \psi \partial_t \theta\) term matches exactly.  
   - The \(\lambda_2 \psi^2\) and \(\lambda_4 \psi^4\) terms match exactly.

Overall, the model expression has two significant errors: the sign in front of the gradient terms is wrong, and the gradient is only one-dimensional rather than full spatial gradient. These are more than minor errors.

Therefore, the expression is incorrect.

\subsection*{Problem 49 (Paper: 2506.21540v1)}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
Background:
Consider a 1+d dimensional field theory described by the Euclidean action for an $N$-component real scalar field $\vec{\psi}$:
$$S = \int \dd^d x \dd t \left[ \frac{1}{2} \vec{\psi} \cdot \left( \hat \lambda_2 - \nabla^2 + \partial_t^2 \nabla^{-2} \right) \vec{\psi} + \frac{\lambda_4}{N} (\vec{\psi}^2)^2 \right]$$
where $\hat \lambda_2$ and $\lambda_4$ are coupling constants, $\nabla^2$ is the $d$-dimensional Laplacian, and $\nabla^{-2}$ is its inverse. The spatial dimension is $d = 2-\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter. A one-loop Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) analysis yields the following flow equation for the coupling $\lambda_4$:
$$\partial_\tau \lambda_4 = \epsilon \lambda_4 - (4N+32) \lambda_4^2 I_2$$
where $\tau = \ln b$ is the RG flow parameter (with $b$ being the rescaling factor). The loop integral $I_2$ is given by:
$$I_2 = \frac{K_d \Lambda}{4  (\hat \lambda_2+ \Lambda^2)^{3/2}}$$
where $K_d = \frac{2^{1-d}\pi^{-d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2)}$ is a constant, and $\Lambda$ is a momentum cutoff. Assume $\hat \lambda_2 \ll \Lambda^2$.

Task:
Derive the simplified one-loop RG flow equation for $\lambda_4$ by evaluating the integral $I_2$ under the given approximation and substituting it into the flow equation. Then, perform a redefinition of $\lambda_4$ to absorb the constant prefactor of the $\lambda_4^2$ term, expressing the final RG equation in terms of the redefined $\lambda_4$.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth Solution}
\[ \boxed{\partial_\tau \lambda_4 = \epsilon \lambda_4 - \lambda_4^2} \]

\paragraph*{Model Solution:}
\; \partial_\tau g = \epsilon\,g - g^{2}\;

\paragraph*{Judge's Evaluation:}

The model-generated expression is:

\[
\partial_\tau g = \epsilon g - g^2
\]

The ground truth expression is:

\[
\partial_\tau \lambda_4 = \epsilon \lambda_4 - \lambda_4^2
\]

The only difference is the variable name: \(g\) instead of \(\lambda_4\). Since the rubric states that differences in variable names do not affect correctness, the expressions are mathematically equivalent.

There are no missing terms, incorrect signs, or coefficients. The structure and form of the expression match exactly.
