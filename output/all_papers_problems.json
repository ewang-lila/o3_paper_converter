The chemical potential $\\mu(\\phi,\\x)$ is derived from a free energy functional $\\F[\\phi] = \\int d^d x\\; \\left[\\dfrac{K(\\phi,\\x)}{2}|\\nabla\\phi|^2+U(\\phi,\\x)\\right]$, where $K$ is an elastic constant and $U$ is a bulk potential. All parameters $K, U, D$ can vary with $\\phi$ and explicitly in space $\\x$.\n\nIn the sharp interface limit, the concentration field is approximated as $\\phi(\\x,t)=\\bphi_-(\\x)+\\Dbp(\\x) \\,\\Theta[\\x,V_+(t)]$, where $\\Theta$ is the indicator function for the volume $V_+(t)$ of the phase with concentration $\\bphi_+(\\x)$, and $\\Dbp(\\x)=\\bphi_+(\\x)-\\bphi_-(\\x)$. The equilibrium bulk concentrations $\\bphi_\\pm(\\x)$ and a common tangent chemical potential $\\comtg(\\x)$ are determined by the conditions:\n$\\left.\\partial_\\phi U(\\phi,\\x)\\right|_{\\bphi_+(\\x)} = \\left.\\partial_\\phi U(\\phi,\\x)\\right|_{\\bphi_-(\\x)} = \\comtg(\\x)$ and $U[\\bphi_+(\\x),\\x]-U[\\bphi_-(\\x),\\x] = \\comtg(\\x)\\Dbp(\\x)$.\nThe surface tension $\\sigma(\\x)$ is given by $\\sigma(\\x)=\\int_{\\bphi_-(\\x)}^{\\bphi_+(\\x)}d\\phi\\,\\sqrt{2 K(\\phi,\\x)[\\tilU(\\phi,\\x)-\\tilU_-(\\x)]}$, where $\\tilU(\\phi,\\x) = U(\\phi,\\x)-\\comtg(\\x)\\phi$ and $\\tilU_-(\\x) \\equiv \\tilU[\\bphi_-(\\x),\\x]$.\n\nFor a $d$-dimensional system, the interface velocity $\\vi(\\X,t)$ at a point $\\X$ on the interface $\\partial V_+(t)$ (with outward normal $\\n(\\Y)$) is governed by the following coupled equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\int_{\\partial V_{+}(t)}dS_{\\Y}\\, \\n(\\Y)\\cdot\\vi(\\Y,t) \\zeta(\\X,\\Y) & = \\frac{1}{\\Dbp(\\X)} \\big[(d-1) H(\\X) \\sigma(\\X) + \\n(\\X) \\cdot\\nabla\\sigma(\\X)\\big] +\\comtg(\\X)-\\mu_{\\infty}~,\\\\\n    \\int_{\\partial V_+(t)}dS_{\\Y}\\, \\n(\\Y)\\cdot\\vi(\\Y,t) \\Dbp(\\Y) & = 0~,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\zeta(\\X,\\Y) \\equiv \\Dbp(\\Y)G_D(\\X,\\Y)$, $H(\\X)$ is the mean curvature of the interface at $\\X$, and $\\mu_{\\infty}$ is an integration constant. The Green's function $G_D(\\x,\\y)$ is defined by $\\partial_x [ D(\\phi,x) \\partial_x G_D(x,y)]=\\delta(x-y)-1/L$ for a periodic domain of size $L$.\n\nConsider a one-dimensional ($d=1$) binary mixture in a periodic domain of length $L$. A droplet of phase $+$ is defined by its left and right interfaces at positions $x_l$ and $x_r$, respectively. The system has a constant mobility $D(\\phi,x)=D$ and constant binodal concentrations $\\bphi_-$ and $\\bphi_+$. This implies that $\\Dbp = \\bphi_+ - \\bphi_-$ is constant, and the common tangent chemical potential $\\comtg$ is also constant. The free energy functional is given by:\n$\\F[\\phi]=\\int dx \\left[ \\dfrac{K}{2}(\\partial_x\\phi)^2+\\dfrac{A(x)}{4}(\\phi-\\bphi_+)^2(\\phi-\\bphi_-)^2 \\right]$.\nFor this system, the mean curvature $H=0$, and the surface tension is $\\sigma(x)= \\frac{1}{6\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{K A(x)}\\Dbp^3$. The Green's function for a 1D periodic domain is $G_D(x,y)=(2D L)^{-1}|x-y|(L - |x-y|)$.\n\nFor this one-dimensional system, the interface equations of motion simplify to:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\dfrac{\\Dbp |x_r - x_l|(L - |x_r - x_l|)}{2 D L}\\dot{x}_r & = -\\dfrac{\\sigma'(x_l)}{\\Dbp} - \\mu_\\infty, \\\\\n    \\dfrac{\\Dbp |x_r - x_l|(L - |x_r - x_l|)}{2 D L}\\dot{x}_l & = -\\dfrac{\\sigma'(x_r)}{\\Dbp} + \\mu_\\infty,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\sigma'(x) = d\\sigma/dx$.\n\n\\task\nDerive the equation of motion for the center of mass $x_{\\rm c} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(x_l + x_r)$ of the droplet, expressing its velocity $v_{\\rm c} = \\dot{x}_{\\rm c}$ in terms of the droplet's size $S = |x_r - x_l|$ and the derivatives of the surface tension.\n\n###",
