In the limit of infinitely many measurement attempts, the mean recurrence time (in units of \\(\\tau\\)) is quantized as \\(w\\): the number of distinct phases \\(\\exp(-i E_k \\tau)\\) for energies \\(E_k\\) with nonzero overlap with \\(|\\psi_\\mathrm{d}\\rangle\\).\n\nHowever, in any experiment, the maximum number of measurement attempts is finite, denoted \\(T_R\\), after which the protocol is restarted if no detection occurs.
