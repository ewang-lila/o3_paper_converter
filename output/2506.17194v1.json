Let $\\beta_b$ be the boundary (edge) magnetization critical exponent and $\\beta_c$ be the corner magnetization critical exponent. The angle between the two adjacent edges forming the corner is denoted by $\\theta$. In the framework of boundary conformal field theory and as shown by Cardy, there is a simple relation connecting these two exponents.  \n\n**Task.** Derive an analytic expression for the corner critical exponent $\\beta_c$ in terms of the boundary exponent $\\beta_b$ and the angle $\\theta$.  \n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\n\\beta_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\theta}\\,\\beta_b.\n\\]\n*(Quoted verbatim from the paper: “The relation of these two critical exponents is  \n\\[\n\\beta_c = \\frac\\pi\\theta\\beta_b,\n\\]\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the edges of the corner.”)*\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2  \n**Background.** The two-dimensional Ising model on a square lattice is described by the Hamiltonian  \n\\[\nH = -\\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle} \\sigma_i\\sigma_j,\n\\]\nwith spins $\\sigma_k\\in\\{0,1\\}$ and the summation running over nearest neighbor pairs. The exact analytical result for the magnetization $M$ in the bulk (i.e. measured at the center of the system) was derived by Yang. The expression involves the hyperbolic sine function and is expressed in reduced units where temperature enters as $1/T$.  \n\n**Task.** Derive the analytic expression for the bulk magnetization $M$ as a function of the temperature $T$.  \n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nM = \\left[ 1- \\frac{1}{\\sinh^4\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{8}}.\n\\]\n*(Quoted verbatim from the paper, Equation (exactbulk):  \n“\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{exactbulk}\nM &= \\left[ 1- \\frac1{\\sinh^4\\left(\\frac1T\\right)}\\right]^{\\frac18},\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}”)*\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3  \n**Background.** For the two-dimensional Ising model, the magnetization measured at the boundary (specifically, on the middle of the border) is given by an exact analytic formula. This expression accounts for the reduced coordination at the edge and involves hyperbolic functions evaluated at $2/T$. The boundary magnetization, denoted by $M_b$, provides a distinct critical behavior compared to the bulk.  \n\n**Task.** Derive the analytic expression for the boundary magnetization $M_b$ in terms of the temperature $T$.  \n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nM_b = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{2}{T}\\right) - \\coth\\left(\\frac{2}{T}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{2}{T}\\right)-1}}.\n\\]\n*(Quoted verbatim from the paper, Equation (\\ref{exactcorner}):  \n“\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{exactcorner}\nM_b &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac2T\\right) - \\coth\\left(\\frac2T\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac2T\\right)-1}},\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}”)*\n\n---\n\n### Problem 4  \n**Background.** In order to extract the critical exponent $\\beta$ from numerical data, one considers the ratio  \n\\[\nR(T) = \\frac{M}{M'},\n\\]\nwhere $M$ is the magnetization and $M'=\\frac{dM}{dT}$ its first derivative with respect to temperature. Near the critical temperature $T_C$, the non-analytical part of the temperature dependence can be removed by a Taylor expansion of $R(T)$ in powers of $(T_C-T)$. This leads to a fitting function characterized by a linear term with coefficient $-1/\\beta$ and a quadratic correction with coefficient $c$.  \n\n**Task.** Derive the analytic form of the fitting function for the ratio $R(T)$ as a function of $T$, including the critical exponent $\\beta$, the critical temperature $T_C$, and the coefficient $c$.  \n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nR(T) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(T_C - T\\right) + c\\left(T_C - T\\right)^2.\n\\]\n*(Quoted verbatim from the paper, Equation (\\ref{rfit}):  \n“\\begin{equation}\\label{rfit}\nR(T) =  -\\frac1\\beta\\left(T_C - T\\right) + c\\left(T_C - T\\right)^2,\n\\end{equation}”)*"
