In this model, the magnetization at a lattice site is given by  \n\\[\nM_{(i_x,i_y)} = \\langle \\sigma_{(i_x,i_y)} \\rangle.\n\\]  \nIn particular, the central (bulk) magnetization is defined as  \n\\[\nM \\equiv \\langle \\sigma_{(N/2, N/2)} \\rangle.\n\\]  \nA well-known analytic result for the bulk magnetization of the Ising model was derived by Yang.  \n\n**Task.**  \nDerive the analytic expression for the exact bulk magnetization \\(M\\) expressed solely in terms of the temperature \\(T\\).  \n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nM = \\left[ 1- \\frac1{\\sinh^4\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)}\\right]^{\\frac18}\n\\quad \\text{(see Equation (4) in the paper).}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2  \n**Background.**  \nIn the two-dimensional Ising model defined on a square lattice (with Hamiltonian  \n\\[\nH = -\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j,\n\\]  \nand with spins \\(\\sigma_k\\in\\{0,1\\}\\)), the central magnetization is given by  \n\\[\nM = \\left[ 1- \\frac{1}{\\sinh^4\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)}\\right]^{\\frac18},\n\\]  \nwhere \\(T\\) is the temperature. To study the temperature dependence near criticality, one considers the first derivative of the magnetization with respect to \\(T\\), defined as  \n\\[\nM' = \\frac{dM}{dT}.\n\\]  \n\n**Task.**  \nDerive the analytic expression for the first derivative \\(M'\\) of the bulk magnetization with respect to the temperature \\(T\\).  \n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nM' = \\frac{1}{T^2M^7}\\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{2}{T}\\right)}{\\sinh^5\\left(\\frac{2}{T}\\right)}\n\\quad \\text{(see the equation following Equation (4) in the paper).}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3  \n**Background.**  \nNear the critical temperature \\(T_C\\) of the two-dimensional Ising model, the singular behavior of the magnetization is characterized by critical exponents. In numerical analyses, the ratio  \n\\[\nR(T) = \\frac{M}{M'}\n\\]  \nis used to extract the critical exponent \\(\\beta\\) (which relates to the leading non-analytical behavior of the magnetization). In the vicinity of \\(T_C\\), this ratio is approximated by a Taylor expansion in \\((T_C - T)\\) as follows:  \n\\[\nR(T) =  -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(T_C - T\\right) + c\\left(T_C - T\\right)^2,\n\\]  \nwhere \\(c\\) is a constant and \\(\\beta\\) is the critical exponent.  \n\n**Task.**  \nDerive the analytic expression for the approximated ratio \\(R(T) = \\frac{M}{M'}\\) in the vicinity of the critical temperature \\(T_C\\), expressing it in the form  \n\\[\nR(T) =  -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(T_C - T\\right) + c\\left(T_C - T\\right)^2.\n\\]\n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nR(T) =  -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(T_C - T\\right) + c\\left(T_C - T\\right)^2\n\\quad \\text{(see Equation (7) in the paper).}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Problem 4  \n**Background.**  \nFor the two-dimensional Ising model on a square lattice with mixed boundary conditions, the boundary (or edge) magnetization is defined at a site on the edge of the lattice. When the magnetization is measured at a site in the middle of the border,  \n\\[\nM_b = \\langle \\sigma_{(1, N/2)} \\rangle,\n\\]  \nan analytic expression for this boundary magnetization is known. This expression involves hyperbolic functions and reflects the altered critical behavior at the boundary compared to the bulk.  \n\n**Task.**  \nDerive the analytic expression for the exact boundary magnetization \\(M_b\\) expressed solely in terms of the temperature \\(T\\).  \n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nM_b = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{2}{T}\\right) - \\coth\\left(\\frac{2}{T}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{2}{T}\\right)-1}}\n\\quad \\text{(see Equation (5) in the paper).}\n\\]"
