The gravitational force per unit area on the fluidized portion of the sample is given by $\\delta (mg/A)$, where $m$ is the total sample mass, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the granular bed, and $\\delta$ is the fraction of the sample mass that becomes fluidized.

The probability of clogging, $P_c$, depends on various parameters, notably the orifice-to-particle size ratio.

This behavior can be modeled using a cumulative distribution function (CDF) derived from a normal distribution. For a random variable $X$ following a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, the cumulative distribution function, $F(x) = P(X \\le x)$, is given by:\n$$F(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\right]$$\nwhere $\\text{erf}(z)$ is the error function.\n\nTask:\nDerive the expression for the clogging probability $P_c(x)$ as a function of $x$, $\\mu$, and $\\sigma$, based on the observation that $P_c(x)$ decreases as $x$ increases.\n\n###",

                "solution": "Looking at this problem, I need to find the melting temperature $T_m$ where the DNA transitions from bound to unbound state.\n\nAt the melting temperature, the condition for phase transition is:\n$$G_{bound} = G_{unbound}$$\n\nSince $G = E - S$ for the dimensionless free energy, I have:\n$$E_{bound} - S_{bound} = E_{unbound} - S_{unbound}$$\n\nThe total dimensionless energy for each state includes both the model energy and the work done by the external force:\n- For bound state: $E_{bound} = E_{model,bound} - \\frac{fy_{bound}}{k_B T_m}$\n- For unbound state: $E_{unbound} = E_{model,unbound} - \\frac{fy_{unbound}}{k_B T_m}$\n\nSubstituting into the equilibrium condition:\n$$E_{model,bound} - \\frac{fy_{bound}}{k_B T_m} - S_{bound} = E_{model,unbound} - \\frac{fy_{unbound}}{k_B T_m} - S_{unbound}$$\n\nRearranging terms:\n$$(E_{model,unbound} - E_{model,bound}) - \\frac{f(y_{unbound} - y_{bound})}{k_B T_m} = S_{unbound} - S_{bound}$$\n\nUsing the definitions:\n- $\\Delta E_{model} = E_{model,unbound} - E_{model,bound}$\n- $\\Delta S_{dimless} = S_{unbound} - S_{bound}$  \n- $\\Delta y = y_{unbound} - y_{bound}$\n\nThis becomes:\n$$\\Delta E_{model} - \\frac{f\\Delta y}{k_B T_m} = \\Delta S_{dimless}$$\n\nHowever, this formulation has an issue. Since $E_{model}$ represents $E_{actual}/(k_B T)$, it depends on temperature. For a more consistent approach, I should work with actual energies.\n\nThe equilibrium condition in terms of actual quantities is:\n$$\\Delta H - f\\Delta y = T_m \\Delta S_{actual}$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta H$ is the enthalpy change. Expressing in terms of the given dimensionless quantities:\n- $\\Delta H = k_B \\Delta E_{model}$ (where $\\Delta E_{model}$ represents the enthalpy change in units of $k_B$)\n- $\\Delta S_{actual} = k_B \\Delta S_{dimless}$\n\nSubstituting:\n$$k_B \\Delta E_{model} - f\\Delta y = T_m k_B \\Delta S_{dimless}$$\n\nSolving for $T_m$:\n$$T_m = \\frac{k_B \\Delta E_{model} - f\\Delta y}{k_B \\Delta S_{dimless}}$$\n\n$$\\boxed{T_m = \\frac{\\Delta E_{model} - \\frac{f\\Delta y}{k_B}}{\\Delta S_{dimless}}}$$\n\nThis expression shows that:\n- When $f = 0$, we recover the standard result $T_m = \\Delta E_{model}/\\Delta S_{dimless}$\n- The applied force effectively reduces the energy barrier for melting by $f\\Delta y$\n- Since DNA typically extends upon melting ($\\Delta y > 0$), a pulling force ($f > 0$) reduces the melting temperature",
                "evaluation": "To evaluate the model-generated solution against the ground truth solution, we need to analyze the derivation and the final expression for the melting temperature \\( T_m \\).\n\n1. **Ground Truth Solution:**\n   \\[\n   T_m = \\frac{f \\Delta y}{k_B (\\Delta E_{model} - \\Delta S_{dimless})}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Model-Generated Solution:**\n   The model-generated solution arrives at:\n   \\[\n   T_m = \\frac{\\Delta E_{model} - \\frac{f\\Delta y}{k_B}}{\\Delta S_{dimless}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Comparison of Expressions:**\n   - The ground truth solution has \\( f \\Delta y \\) in the numerator, while the model-generated solution has \\( \\Delta E_{model} - \\frac{f\\Delta y}{k_B} \\) in the numerator.\n   - The denominator in the ground truth solution is \\( k_B (\\Delta E_{model} - \\Delta S_{dimless}) \\), while the model-generated solution has \\( \\Delta S_{dimless} \\) alone.\n\n4. **Identifying Errors:**\n   - The model-generated solution incorrectly manipulates the terms involving the force \\( f \\) and the energy changes. The factor of \\( k_B \\) is crucial in the context of the energy terms and their relationship to temperature.\n   - The model-generated solution does not correctly reflect the relationship between the changes in energy and entropy as defined in the problem statement.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The model-generated solution contains fundamental errors in the formulation of the melting temperature. It does not match the ground truth solution and fails to maintain the correct relationships between the variables involved.\n   - Given that there are more than two fundamental errors in the model-generated solution, it is classified as incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the score for the model-generated solution is:\n\nScore: 0",
