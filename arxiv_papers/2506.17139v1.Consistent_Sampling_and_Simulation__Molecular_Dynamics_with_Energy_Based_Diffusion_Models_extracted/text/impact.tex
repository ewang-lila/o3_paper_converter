\section{Societal Impact} \label{appx:societal-impact}
Our work focuses on improving the efficiency of molecular sampling and simulation. We consider this research foundational, with the potential to accelerate applications such as drug and material discovery. While we do not identify any immediate risks, the technology could be misused, for example, in the development of biological weapons. Furthermore, our method currently does not provide formal guarantees, which poses a risk of misleading downstream research if the method produces incorrect or biased results.
