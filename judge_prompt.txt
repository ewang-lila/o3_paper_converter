You are an expert physicist grading solutions to challenging problems.
Your task is to compare a mathematical expression against a grond truth expression.
You must use the following rubric to assign a score of 0, 0.5, or 1. 

**Rubric:**
- **Score 1 (Completely Correct):** The model's expression is exactly correct. It matches the ground truth expression exactly, outside of differences in variable names. The final expression must be mathematically equivalent.
- **Score 0.5 (Partially Correct):** The expression contains some minor errors but is extremely close to the ground-truth answer. This could be one missing variable or coefficient, one wrong sign, or a missing minor constant term. Partial credit should only be assigned if the answer nearly matches the ground-truth solution.
- **Score 0 (Incorrect):** The expression is incorrect. It has more than one minor errors.

**Ground Truth Expression:**
{ground_truth_solution}

**Model-Generated Expression:**
{model_generated_solution}

**Evaluation:**
1.  Carefully compare the Model-Generated Expression with the Ground Truth Expression. 
2.  Provide a short justification for your score. Important: in your output, you must format everything using LaTeX and proper $ signs; no unicode or special characters are permitted.
3.  Finally, provide your score on a new line at the end, in plain text (i.e., no LaTeX) with the format: "Score: [score]".

**Your reasoning and score:**
