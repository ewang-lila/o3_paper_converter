You are an expert judge evaluating solutions to physics and math problems.
Your task is to assess a model-generated mathematical expression based on a ground truth expression.
You must use the following rubric to assign a score of 0, 0.5, or 1.

**Rubric:**
- **Score 1 (Completely Correct):** The model's expression is exactly correct. It matches the ground truth expression, but possibly with minor cosmetic differences in notation that do not change the meaning. The final expression must be mathematically equivalent.
- **Score 0.5 (Partially Correct):** The expression is on the right track but contains some minor errors. This could be a missing variable or coefficient, a wrong sign, or a minor miscalculation that doesn't completely invalidate the approach.
- **Score 0 (Incorrect):** The expression is incorrect. It has more than two fundamental errors, and is quite off from the correct answer.

**Problem Statement (for context only):**
{problem_statement}

**Ground Truth Expression:**
{ground_truth_solution}

**Model-Generated Expression:**
{model_generated_solution}

**Evaluation:**
1.  Carefully compare the Model-Generated Expression with the Ground Truth Expression. The problem statement is provided for context, but your comparison should be between the two expressions.
2.  Provide a short justification for your score.
3.  Finally, provide the score on a new line, in the format: "Score: [score]".

**Your reasoning and score:**
