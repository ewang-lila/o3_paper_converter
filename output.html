Background:  
Consider a system of $N$ positive ions (charge $q^+$) and $N$ negative ions (charge $q^-$) within a cuboid domain $\Omega = [0,L_1] \times [0,L_2] \times [0,L_3]$. The system is subject to periodic boundary conditions. The state of the system at time $t$ is given by the $6N$-dimensional vector of all ion positions, $\overline{\mathbf{X}}(t)$. A statistical description of the system is provided by the time-dependent probability density function $p(\overline{\mathbf{x}}, t)$, where $\overline{\mathbf{x}} = [\mathbf{x}_1^+, \dots, \mathbf{x}_N^+, \mathbf{x}_1^-, \dots, \mathbf{x}_N^-]$ is a point in the state space. The macroscopic concentrations of the ions, $c^\pm(\mathbf{x}, t)$, are defined as $N$ times the marginal probability density of a single ion of a given species. Since the ions of a given species are indistinguishable, this can be written as:
$$c^\pm\big(\mathbf{x},t\big) = N \int_{ \Omega^{2N-1}} p \Big(\mathbf{x},\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}^\pm_1,t\Big) \, \mbox{d} \widetilde{\mathbf{x}}^\pm_1$$
where $\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}^\pm_1$ denotes the coordinates of all ions except for the first ion of the specified type ($\pm$). The system also contains a fixed, permanent charge density $\varrho_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$. The microscopic electrostatic potential $\widehat{\phi}(\mathbf{x}; \overline{\mathbf{y}})$ at a point $\mathbf{x}$ for a given configuration of ions $\overline{\mathbf{y}}$ is determined by the Poisson equation, accounting for all ions and their periodic images:
$$ </h3><br>abla^2 \widehat{\phi}\big(\mathbf{x}; \overline{\mathbf{y}}\big) = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_0 \, \varepsilon} \sum_{\boldsymbol{\ell}} \left[ \varrho_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x}\!- \!{\mathbf{L}}_{\boldsymbol{\ell}}) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Big( q^+ \, \delta^3 \big(\mathbf{x}\!-\!\mathbf{y}_i^+ \!\!-\! {\mathbf{L}}_{\boldsymbol{\ell}}\big) + q^- \, \delta^3 \big(\mathbf{x}\!-\!\mathbf{y}_i^- \!\!-\! {\mathbf{L}}_{\boldsymbol{\ell}}\big) \Big) \right] $$
Here, $\varepsilon_0$ and $\varepsilon$ are permittivity constants, $\delta^3$ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function, and the sum is over all integer vectors $\boldsymbol{\ell}=[\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3]$ with ${\mathbf{L}}_{\boldsymbol{\ell}} = [\ell_1 L_1, \ell_2 L_2, \ell_3 L_3]$ representing the periodic lattice vectors. The macroscopic, or mean-field, electrostatic potential $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as the average of this microscopic potential over all possible ion configurations:
$$ \phi\big(\mathbf{x}\big) = \int_{\Omega^{2N}} \widehat{\phi}\big(\mathbf{x}; \overline{\mathbf{y}}\big) \, p\big({\overline{\mathbf{y}}},t\big) \, \mbox{d} \overline{\mathbf{y}} $$

Task:
Using the definitions provided, derive the macroscopic Poisson equation satisfied by the averaged electrostatic potential $\phi(\mathbf{x})$. Your final expression should relate the Laplacian of $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ to the macroscopic concentrations $c^\pm(\mathbf{x})$ and the permanent charge density $\varrho_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$ within the primary domain $\Omega$.

Background:  
Consider a system of $N$ positive ions and $N$ negative ions in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, which is periodically repeated throughout space. The state of the system at time $t$ is given by the $6N$-dimensional vector of particle positions $\overline{\mathbf{X}}(t) = [\mathbf{X}_1^+(t), \dots, \mathbf{X}_N^+(t), \mathbf{X}_1^-(t), \dots, \mathbf{X}_N^-(t)]$. The system also contains a fixed, permanent charge density $\varrho_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$. For a given configuration of ions at positions $\overline{\mathbf{y}} = [\mathbf{y}_1^+, \dots, \mathbf{y}_N^+, \mathbf{y}_1^-, \dots, \mathbf{y}_N^-]$, the corresponding electrostatic potential $\widehat{\phi}(\mathbf{x}; \overline{\mathbf{y}})$ is the solution to the Poisson equation for point charges, including all periodic images:
$$
</h3><br>abla^2 \widehat{\phi}\big(\mathbf{x}; \overline{\mathbf{y}}\big) 
= -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_0 \, \varepsilon} \sum_{\boldsymbol{\ell}}

$$
where $q^\pm$ are the ion charges, $\varepsilon_0$ and $\varepsilon$ are permittivity constants, $\delta^3(\cdot)$ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function, and the sum is over all integer vectors $\boldsymbol{\ell}=[\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3]$ defining the periodic lattice vectors ${\mathbf{L}}_{\boldsymbol{\ell}}$. The stochastic evolution of the system is described by a time-dependent probability density function $p(\overline{\mathbf{y}}, t)$ over the $6N$-dimensional state space. The macroscopic (mean) concentration of positive and negative ions, $c^\pm(\mathbf{x}, t)$, is defined as the sum of the marginal densities for each ion. Assuming the ions of the same species are indistinguishable, this is given by:
$$
c^\pm\big(\mathbf{x},t\big) = N 
\int_{ \Omega^{2N-1}} p \Big(\mathbf{x},\widetilde{\mathbf{y}}^\pm_1,t\Big) \, \mbox{d}
\widetilde{\mathbf{y}}^\pm_1
$$
where $\widetilde{\mathbf{y}}^\pm_1$ represents all ion coordinates except for the first ion of the specified type, which is fixed at $\mathbf{x}$. The mean electrostatic potential $\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)$ is defined as the expectation of $\widehat{\phi}(\mathbf{x}; \overline{\mathbf{y}})$ over all possible ion configurations:
$$
\phi\big(\mathbf{x}, t\big)
=
\int_{\Omega^{2N}}
\widehat{\phi}\big(\mathbf{x}; \overline{\mathbf{y}}\big) 
\, p\big({\overline{\mathbf{y}}},t\big) \, \mbox{d} \overline{\mathbf{y}}
$$

Task:
Starting from the definition of the mean electrostatic potential $\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)$, derive the macroscopic Poisson equation that it satisfies. Your final expression should relate the Laplacian of $\phi$ to the macroscopic concentrations $c^\pm(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and the permanent charge density $\varrho_{\mathrm{p}}(\mathbf{x})$.

Background:  
A multi-resolution simulation method couples a particle-based Brownian Dynamics (BD) model with a continuum Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model. The computational domain $\Omega$ is divided into a BD region $\Omega_B$ and a PNP region $\Omega_P$. The state of the system at time $t$ is described by the positions of $N_B^\pm(t)$ individual ions in $\Omega_B$ and concentration fields $c^\pm(\mathbf{x}, t)$ for ions in $\Omega_P$. The total number of ions of each species in $\Omega$ is a constant, $N$.

At each time step $\Delta t$, the concentration fields $c^\pm(\mathbf{x}, t)$ are evolved to an intermediate state $c^{*,\pm}(\mathbf{x}, t+\Delta t)$ using the PNP equations. Due to diffusion, $c^{*,\pm}$ may be non-zero in a region $\Omega_B \setminus \Omega_P$. The mean number of ions that &quot;spill over&quot; from the PNP domain into this region is calculated as $\mu^\pm(t + \Delta t) = \int_{\Omega_B\setminus\Omega_P} c^{*,\pm}({\mathbf{x}}, t + \Delta t) \, \mbox{d}{\mathbf{x}}$. This quantity is interpreted as the probability of creating a new BD particle. To ensure the total number of particles $N$ is conserved, the updated concentration field in $\Omega_P$ is rescaled by a factor $\gamma^\pm$. This factor depends on whether a new particle is actually created. The number of ions described by the PNP model at time $t$ is $N_P^\pm(t) = N - N_B^\pm(t)$. After the evolution step, the total number of particles represented by the concentration field $c^{*,\pm}$ within the PNP domain $\Omega_P$ is $\int_{\Omega_P} c^{*,\pm}(\mathbf{x}, t+\Delta t) \, \mbox{d}{\mathbf{x}} = N_P^\pm(t) - \mu^\pm(t+\Delta t)$.

Task:  
Based on the principle of particle number conservation, derive the scaling factors $\gamma_{(i)}^\pm$ and $\gamma_{(ii)}^\pm$ that must be applied to the intermediate concentration field $c^{*,\pm}$ in the domain $\Omega_P$. The factor $\gamma_{(i)}^\pm$ corresponds to the case where no new BD particle is created, and $\gamma_{(ii)}^\pm$ corresponds to the case where one new BD particle is created. Express your final answer in terms of $N$, $N_B^\pm(t)$, and $\mu^\pm(t + \Delta t)$.

###</h3>
<strong>Solution:</strong>
\[\gamma_{(i)}^\pm = \frac{N - N_B^\pm(t)}{N - N_B^\pm(t) - \mu^\pm(t + \Delta t)}\,,
\qquad
\gamma_{(ii)}^\pm = \frac{N - N_B^\pm(t)-1}{N - N_B^\pm(t) - \mu^\pm(t + \Delta t)}\]</div>

        <div class='problem'><h3>Problem 1

Background:  
A model for a cluster of mutually repelling particles in 2D confinement considers the competition between inter-particle repulsion and an external confining potential. The confining potential is generated by $M$ fixed particles, which are uniformly distributed on the perimeter of a circle of radius $R$. The interaction between any two particles (cluster-cluster, or cluster-confining) separated by a distance $d$ is described by a potential energy $u(d) = u_0 d^{-\alpha}$, where $u_0$ is an energy constant and $\alpha$ is a positive exponent. We consider a single particle from the main cluster, which, due to the circular symmetry of the system, is located at a radial distance $r_p$ from the center. To simplify the analysis, we use dimensionless quantities by setting the confinement radius $R=1$ and measuring energy in units of $u_0$. The cluster particle is thus at a dimensionless radial position $\rho = r_p/R$. Let this particle be located on the positive x-axis, with polar coordinates $(\rho, 0)$. The $M$ confining particles are at fixed polar coordinates $(1, 2\pi k/M)$ for $k=1, 2, ..., M$.

Task:  
For the single cluster particle at $(\rho, 0)$, derive the total dimensionless potential energy, $U_C(\rho)$, arising from its interaction with all $M$ confining particles.

###</h3>
<strong>Solution:</strong>
\[U_{C}(\rho)=\sum_{k=1}^{M} \left[1 + \rho^2 - 2\rho\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{M}\right)\right]^{-\alpha/2}\]</div><div class='problem'><h3>Problem 2

Background:  
A model system consists of $N$ mutually repelling particles that are confined by an external potential generated by $M$ fixed sources. The particles and sources are arranged in a two-dimensional plane. The total potential energy of the system is given by the expression:
$u = C \left[ \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j </h3><br>eq i}}^N r_{ij}^{-3} + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^M r_{ik}^{-3} \right]$.
Here, $r_{ij}$ is the distance between particles $i$ and $j$, $r_{ik}$ is the distance between particle $i$ and the fixed source $k$, $C$ is a constant with units of energy $\times$ length$^3$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless parameter that represents the ratio of the confining strength to the repulsion strength. The particles are confined within an ellipse with semi-major axis $a$ and semi-minor axis $b$. The ellipse&#x27;s area is held constant at $\pi ab = \pi$, and its eccentricity is $\epsilon = \sqrt{1-(b/a)^2}$. The particle positions $(x_i, y_i)$ can be described by dimensionless coordinates $\eta_i = x_i/a$ and $\xi_i = y_i/b$.

Task:
Derive the dimensionless total energy, defined as $U_{\mathrm{tot}} = u / (C a^{-3})$, and express it in terms of the dimensionless coordinates $(\eta_i, \xi_i)$ for the particles and $(\eta_k, \xi_k)$ for the sources, the eccentricity $\epsilon$, and the parameter $\lambda$.

###
<strong>Solution:</strong>
\[U_{\mathrm{tot}} = \sum_{\substack{j = 1 \\ i\neq j}}^{N}\left[(\eta_i - \eta_j)^2 + (1+\epsilon^2)(\xi_i - \xi_j)^2\right]^{-3/2} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^{M} \left[(\eta_i - \eta_k)^2 + (1+\epsilon^2)(\xi_i - \xi_k)^2\right]^{-3/2}\]</div><div class='problem'><h3>Problem 3

Background:  
Consider a two-dimensional system of $N$ mutually repelling particles at positions $(X_i, Y_i)$ for $i=1, \dots, N$. These particles are confined by $M$ fixed particles at positions $(X_k, Y_k)$ for $k=1, \dots, M$. The interaction between any two particles (either moving or fixed) is described by a pairwise potential $u(r) = r^{-\alpha}$, where $r$ is the distance between the particles and $\alpha &gt; 0$ is a dimensionless exponent. The total potential energy of the system, $U_{\mathrm{tot}}$, is modeled by separating the confinement and repulsion contributions. The confinement-to-repulsion strength is described by a set of parameters $\lambda_i$, one for each particle. The total potential energy is given by:
$$U_{\mathrm{tot}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^M \left[(X_i - X_k)^2 + (Y_i - Y_k)^2\right]^{-\alpha/2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j </h3><br>eq i} \lambda_i \left[(X_i - X_j)^2 + (Y_i - Y_j)^2\right]^{-\alpha/2}$$
At an equilibrium configuration, the net force on each particle is zero. This implies that the partial derivative of the total energy with respect to each coordinate of each particle is zero, i.e., $\frac{\partial U_{\mathrm{tot}}}{\partial X_i} = 0$ for all $i$.

Task:  
For an arbitrary particle $i$ in an equilibrium configuration, apply the condition $\frac{\partial U_{\mathrm{tot}}}{\partial X_i} = 0$ to the given energy expression. Using the notation $\Delta X_{ab} = X_a - X_b$ and $\Delta Y_{ab} = Y_a - Y_b$, derive the expression for the parameter $\lambda_i$ that must be satisfied.

###
<strong>Solution:</strong>
\[\lambda_i = -\frac{\sum_{k=1}^M \Delta X_{ik}\left(\Delta X^2_{ik} + \Delta Y^2_{ik}\right)^{-(\alpha + 2)/2}}{\sum_{j\neq i}^N \Delta X_{ij}\left(\Delta X^2_{ij} + \Delta Y^2_{ij}\right)^{-(\alpha + 2)/2}}\]</div>

        <div class='problem'><h3>Problem 1

Background:  
Consider a continuous-time quantum walk on a finite graph. The system is initialized in a state $\ket{\psi_\text{in}}$. At discrete time intervals $\tau, 2\tau, 3\tau, \dots$, a projective measurement is performed to check if the system is in a target state $\ket{\psi_\text{d}}$. For the recurrence problem, the initial and target states are identical, $\ket{\psi_\text{in}} = \ket{\psi_\text{d}}$. Let $F_n$ be the probability that the particle is detected for the first time at the $n$-th measurement (time $n\tau$). For an infinitely long experiment, the mean recurrence time (in units of $\tau$) is an integer, $\langle n \rangle = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n F_n = w$, where $w$ is the number of distinct energy phase factors involved.

In a realistic experiment, measurements can only be performed for a finite duration. This is modeled by a restart protocol where the process is stopped if no detection occurs by the $T_R$-th measurement. The conditional mean recurrence time, $\langle n \rangle_{\text{Con}}$, is the mean time to detection, given that detection occurs at or before step $T_R$. It is defined as $\langle n \rangle_{\text{Con}} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{T_R} nF_n}{\sum_{n=1}^{T_R} F_n}$.

Near a resonance where the mean time transitions from $w$ to $w-1$, the system exhibits a slow-decaying mode. This mode is associated with an eigenvalue of the survival operator, $z_m$, whose modulus approaches unity. In this regime, the first-detection probability for large $n$ can be approximated as $F_n \approx (1-|z_m|^2)^2 |z_m|^{2n}$. Let $|z_m|^2 = 1-\epsilon^2$, where $\epsilon$ is a small parameter that quantifies the deviation from the exact resonance point.

Task:  
In the limit where $T_R \to \infty$ and $\epsilon \to 0$ such that their product $\sigma = T_R \epsilon^2$ remains finite, derive the expression for the conditional mean recurrence time $\langle n \rangle_{\text{Con}}$ as a function of $w$ and $\sigma$.

###</h3>
<strong>Solution:</strong>
\[\langle n \rangle_{\text{Con}} = w - (\sigma + 1) e^{-\sigma}\]</div><div class='problem'><h3>Problem 2

Background:  
Consider a continuous-time quantum walk on a finite graph, governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian $H$. The system is initialized in a specific state $\ket{\psi_{\text{d}}}$. The position of the walker is measured stroboscopically at time intervals $\tau$. The recurrence problem studies the statistics of the first time the walker is detected back in the initial state $\ket{\psi_{\text{d}}}$. The probability of first detection at time $n\tau$ is denoted $F_n$. For such a system, the theoretical mean recurrence time, in units of $\tau$, is an integer winding number, $\langle n \rangle = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n F_n = w$.

In a realistic setting, the experiment is performed for a maximum of $T_R$ measurements. If no detection occurs, the process is restarted. This leads to the definition of the unconditional mean restarted hitting time, $\langle n_R \rangle$. It is related to the conditional mean, $\langle n \rangle_{\text{Con}}$, and the total detection probability within $T_R$ attempts, $P_\text{det}(T_R) = \sum_{n=1}^{T_R} F_n$, by the formula:
$$ \expval{n_R} = \expval{n}_\text{Con} + \frac{1-P_\text{det}(T_R)}{P_\text{det}(T_R)} T_R $$
In the vicinity of a resonance where the winding number transitions from $w \to w-1$, the variance of the recurrence time, $\text{Var}(n)$, becomes very large. In the limit of large $T_R$ and large $\text{Var}(n)$, the following asymptotic relations hold:
$$ \langle n \rangle_{\text{Con}} \approx w - (\sigma + 1)e^{-\sigma} $$
$$ P_\text{det}(T_R) \approx 1 - \frac{\sigma}{T_R} e^{-\sigma} $$
where the dimensionless parameter $\sigma$ is defined as $\sigma = \frac{2T_R}{\text{Var}(n)}$.

Task:
Using these relations, derive the expression for the unconditional mean restarted hitting time, $\langle n_R \rangle$, as a function of the winding number $w$, the restart time $T_R$, and the variance of the recurrence time $\text{Var}(n)$.

<strong>Solution:</strong>
\[\expval{n_R} = w - \exp \left[-2 T_R/\text{Var}(n) \right]\]</div><div class='problem'><h3>Problem 3

Background:
Consider a continuous-time quantum walk on a finite linear segment of $L$ sites, described by the tight-binding Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma \sum_{x=1}^{L-1} (\ket{x} \bra{x+1} + \ket{x+1} \bra{x})$, where $\gamma$ is the hopping amplitude. The energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors are given by $E_k = -2\gamma \cos[k\pi/(L+1)]$ and $\ket{E_k} = \sqrt{2/(L+1)} \sum_{x=1}^L \sin[k\pi x/(L+1)] \ket{x}$ for $k=1, 2, \dots, L$. The system is prepared in the state $\ket{\psi_\text{in}} = \ket{1}$ and is stroboscopically measured every $\tau$ seconds to detect if it has returned to the same site, $\ket{\psi_\text{d}} = \ket{1}$. The experiment is conducted with a restart protocol, where each trial is terminated and restarted if no detection occurs after a maximum of $T_R$ measurements. Near a resonance where two energy phases merge, the mean recurrence time under restart, $\langle n_R \rangle$, can be approximated by the expression:
$$
\expval{n_R} = w - \exp \left[ -\lambda T_R (\widetilde{\Delta E \tau })^2 \right]
$$
Here, $w$ is the number of distinct energy phases with non-zero overlap with the detection state. The resonance is caused by the merging of phases corresponding to two energies, $E_+$ and $E_-$, and the deviation from resonance is $\widetilde{\Delta E \tau } = (\tau |E_+ - E_-| \mod 2\pi)$. The parameter $\lambda$ is defined as $\lambda = p_+ p_- / (p_+ + p_-)^3$, where $p_\pm = |\langle \psi_\text{d} | E_\pm \rangle|^2$ are the overlaps with the respective energy eigenstates.

Task:
Consider the resonance formed by the merging of the ground state ($k=1$) and the highest energy state ($k=L$). For a system with a large number of sites $L$, determine the expression for the restarted mean recurrence time $\langle n_R \rangle$ for a quantum walk on this linear segment, where the particle is measured at the end node ($\ket{\psi_\text{d}}=\ket{1}$). Your final expression should depend on $L$, $T_R$, $\gamma$, and $\tau$.

\[\langle n_R \rangle = L - \exp \left[ - \frac{(L+1)^3}{16\pi^2} T_R \left( 4\gamma\tau \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{L+1}\right) \mod 2\pi \right)^2 \right]\]</div>
