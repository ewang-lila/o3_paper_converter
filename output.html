<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Consider a finite quantum system with a time-independent Hamiltonian ( H ) having (possibly degenerate) eigenvalues ( {E_k}_{k=1,\dots,w} ), with associated eigenstates ( |E_k\rangle ).<br />
A stroboscopic measurement protocol is performed: The system starts at the state ( |\psi_\text{in}\rangle = |\psi_\text{d}\rangle ), and, after every interval ( \tau ), a projective measurement is made to test for arrival at ( |\psi_\text{d}\rangle ). The evolution between measurements is unitary, ( U(\tau) = \exp(-i H \tau) ) (( \hbar = 1 )). Let ( F_n ) be the probability that the first successful detection occurs at the ( n )-th measurement event (i.e., at time ( n\tau )). Let the set ( {p_k} ) be defined as ( p_k := |\langle E_k | \psi_\text{d} \rangle|^2 ), and let ( w ) be the number of *distinct* phase factors ( e^{-i E_k \tau} ) with ( p_k \neq 0 ).</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong><br />
Derive an explicit formula for the mean first return time ( \langle n \rangle = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n F_n ) and show that it is equal to the winding number ( w ), i.e.,<br />
[
\langle n \rangle = w,
]
where ( w ) is the number of distinct nonzero-overlap energy phase factors as defined above.</p>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>Consider a quantum walk on a finite graph, evolving under a time-independent Hamiltonian ( H ), with periodic stroboscopic projective measurements performed every interval (\tau). The system is initialized and monitored at state (|\psi_\mathrm{d}\rangle) (the recurrence problem). Let (n) be the random number of measurements until the first detection. In the limit of infinitely many measurement attempts, the mean recurrence time (in units of (\tau)) is quantized as (w): the number of distinct phases (\exp(-i E_k \tau)) for energies (E_k) with nonzero overlap with (|\psi_\mathrm{d}\rangle).</p>

<p>However, in any experiment, the maximum number of measurement attempts is finite, denoted (T_R), after which the protocol is restarted if no detection occurs. The mean number of attempts until first detection, conditioned on occurrence within (T_R) measurements, is denoted ( \langle n \rangle_{\mathrm{Con}} ).</p>

<p>Near a resonance where two phase factors (\exp(-iE_+\tau)) and (\exp(-iE_-\tau)) nearly coincide (i.e., (\tau |E_+ - E_-| \mod 2\pi \approx 0)), exactly one zero (z_m) of the survival generating function approaches the unit circle, with (|z_m|^2 = 1 - \epsilon^2), where (\epsilon \ll 1). In this regime, the variance of (n) for infinite (T_R) is given by
[
\mathrm{Var}(n) \approx \frac{2}{\epsilon^2}.
]</p>

<p>Task:</p>

<p>Using the above, derive an explicit expression for the conditional mean ( \langle n \rangle_{\mathrm{Con}} ) in terms of (w), the finite restart time (T_R), and the variance (\mathrm{Var}(n)) near the resonance (i.e., for (\epsilon\rightarrow 0), large (T_R), but (\sigma = \epsilon^2 T_R) finite). Your final expression should contain only (w), (T_R), and (\mathrm{Var}(n)), with no dependence on (\epsilon) or (z_m).</p>

<strong>Solution:</strong>
\[\langle n \rangle_{\mathrm{Con}}
= w - \left[ \frac{2 T_R}{\mathrm{Var}(n)} + 1\right] \exp\left[ -\frac{2 T_R}{\mathrm{Var}(n)}\right]\]</div><div class='problem'><h3>Problem 3</h3>

<p>Background:<br />
Consider a finite-dimensional quantum system with time-independent Hamiltonian ( H ) (with ( \hbar=1 )), subjected to repeated projective measurements at fixed intervals ( \tau ), where the initial and detection state coincide, ( |\psi_\mathrm{in}\rangle = |\psi_\mathrm{d}\rangle ). Define the quantum first-detection protocol: at each time ( n\tau ), perform a projective measurement onto ( |\psi_\mathrm{d}\rangle ) and record the first “yes” outcome; repeat the process for an ensemble and consider only realizations where detection occurs within ( T_R ) measurement attempts (i.e., within time ( T_R \tau )). Let the first-detection probability at step ( n ) be ( F_n ), and the conditional mean number of measurements is
[
\langle n \rangle_\text{Con} = \frac{ \sum_{n=1}^{T_R} n F_n }{ \sum_{n=1}^{T_R} F_n }.
]
In the vicinity of a topological transition, suppose that ( F_n \approx a(z_m)|z_m|^{2n} ) for large ( n ), where ( |z_m| \lesssim 1 ) is the modulus of the zero of the generating function closest to the unit circle, so that ( a(z_m) \approx (1 - |z_m|^2)^2 ).</p>

<p>Show that in the joint limit ( |z_m|^2 = 1-\epsilon^2 ) with ( \epsilon \ll 1 ), and ( T_R \to \infty ) such that ( \sigma = T_R \epsilon^2 ) is finite, the conditional mean number of measurement steps satisfies
[
\langle n \rangle_\text{Con} = w - (\sigma + 1) e^{-\sigma}
]
where ( w ) is the quantized mean for infinite measurement time, and ( \sigma = T_R \epsilon^2 ).</p>
